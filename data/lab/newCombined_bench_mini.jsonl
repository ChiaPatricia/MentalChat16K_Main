{"question_id": 1334, "category": "generic", "turns": ["I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I\u2019ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I\u2019m about to lose her, if I already haven\u2019t. I throw things at her when I\u2019m angry, and sometimes I hit her. I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her. I don\u2019t want to lose her, and I don\u2019t want the situation to worsen. I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood. I'm ready to change. I need help now. I'm about to explode."]}
