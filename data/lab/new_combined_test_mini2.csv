"I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy).",,"Your insistence on knowing where people live might be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by distressing thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that a person feels they need to perform in order to reduce their distressing thoughts. An evaluation from a mental health professional could determine if you have OCD.Each time you feel anxious about not knowing where someone lives, and subsequently seek out their address in order to reduce your anxiety, you strengthen your anxiety. It might sound counterintuitive, but by giving into your anxiety, in an effort to reduce it, you actually make it worse. The way to overcome this is to resist your urge to acquire a person’s address and endure the anxiety. Your anxiety level will increase at first, but it will soon decrease. Many people are unwilling to endure anxiety and to their detriment, seek ways to escape it.Let’s also examine your logic. In order for you to trust someone, you must know where they live, but I am not aware of any research that suggests trustworthiness can be determined by knowing where someone lives. It is illogical. Every serial killer has or had an address. Had you known their address you would have been no safer. It would have told you nothing about their trustworthiness.Trustworthiness is earned over time. When first meeting someone you don’t know if you can trust them or not. You don’t know them well enough to make that judgment. Generally, if a person demonstrates they can be relied upon, they are worthy of your trust.A mental health professional can assist you in analyzing your logic and correcting irrational thoughts. Left untreated, OCD tends to be a progressive disorder but early intervention can prevent that from happening. Please take care."
"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I am feeling very clueless at times. I don’t know what I want out of life in general. I’m basically sitting here, accepting failure and it’s not worrying me as much as it should. I’ve been feeling drastically lazy. Pretty much I just sit and watch TV and just spend my time very unproductively and don’t want to be this way. I’m not depressed; it’s just my mind and body won’t allow me to do things that I should be doing. If you suggest anything, please let me know. Thank you.",,"You are motivated enough to ask the question. That’s a very good place to start. Let’s build on that.You are in your freshman year. My first question to you is whether you really want to be in college. Many teens go off to school because it is expected or because they don’t know what else to do. They are not there because they are passionate about a subject or excited about entering the professional world. The sudden lack of structure from the scheduled days of high school to the very unscheduled life of a college student isn’t necessarily freeing. Some students don’t yet have the internal structures necessary to schedule themselves. So they end up doing what you are doing: Not getting to class and not doing much. You might find this article helpful.If you recognize yourself in that article, I suggest you take a break from college. Do a gap year program or get out there and work until you figure out what you want to do in life. College is too expensive in time and money to just hang out there. Here are some suggestions for other ways to have new experiences and to grow.On the other hand: If you are really, really excited about school but just can’t get yourself up and out every day, there may be something else going on. If that’s the case, please make an appointment with your doctor for a complete medical check. If your body isn’t healthy, your mind won’t work as it should either. Sleep disorders can kill motivation and sap us of energy. Make sure you are getting eight hours of sleep regularly. Make sure you are eating right and getting a workout at least three days a week.If that all checks out and you are still feeling stuck, you might want to look into what mental health services are available at your school. You don’t have to have a diagnosable psychiatric problem to benefit from some counseling. Sometimes a counselor can provide support and advice while you figure things out for yourself.Please give yourself credit for recognizing that something is wrong and doing something about it. By acting now, you saved yourself years of feeling bad about yourself.I wish you well."
"Hi, within the past year I have been hospitalized three times and I have been in two treatment centers. I have been diagnosed with everything from Borderline to Bipolar with Psychosis, but all of my treating physicians say that those diagnosis’ are incorrect. I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can’t tell the difference between different emotions, I don’t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don’t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren’t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can’t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it’s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have people pulling me every which a way, I am tired of all of this. I feel like no one understands me. I know you don’t know me but can you tell me possibly what is going on. I would appreciate anything. Thank you!",,"I would tend to agree with your psychiatrist, who suggested that feeling as though you’re living in two worlds may be a coping mechanism. It’s also possible that the two-worlds feeling is a symptom of psychosis.Other explanations include your disassociation is to blame or it may be that your medications are interacting in a negative way. Being on the wrong medication could also be part of the problem.Unfortunately, it’s impossible for me to make a determination about what might be wrong without having the ability to interview you in person. I would suggest attempting to find a mental health professional whom you trust and feel to be competent. This is not to suggest that your current providers are incompetent but perhaps you haven’t found the right treatment providers for your needs.Understandably, it’s difficult to make these inquiries while continuing to experience intrusive symptoms, but it’s worthwhile to search for professionals who can meet your needs.You might try dialectical behavioral treatment (DBT). DBT is a specific type of intensive therapy that targets many of the symptoms described. Some of the concepts for DBT were derived from Buddhists meditative practices. Studies have found that DBT can be quite effective. I hope this helps. Please take care."
"My 19 year old brother may be clinically depressed. He does not want to take any direction in his life. He does not want to do the typical things that a teenager would normally do. Meaning, he does not want to get a job. He does not want to finish college (he wants to quit). He does not want to get a driver’s license. In fact, he doesn’t seem to think that these types of things even matter.",,"Approach him with compassion. Say to him, as a family if possible, that you have noticed that he does not seem happy, motivated or interested in making a life for himself. Tell him that you all are concerned about him and his well-being and suggest that he seek help.Based on what you have described to me, he does seem to be experiencing some sort of depression. I am not sure exactly how your brother will react to your family’s concerns and the suggestion of a counselor but it is about all that your family can do in this situation. It will be up to your brother to get help and if he is not motivated to do so, there is little that you can to make him go.According to the Healthy Place website, there are three ways to beat feeling a lack of motivation due to depression, which may be a more useful approach in conjunction with therapy.1. Identify the Essentials When you’re depressed and lack motivation, you may need to adjust your ideas about what is essential and what isn’t. Doing the dishes is essential; polishing the faucet isn’t.2. Break Up Large Tasks Into Smaller, Easier Ones Okay, so the kitchen needs cleaning. There are dirty dishes everywhere. But it’s such a huge job when we’re depressed that we let it go and it becomes much worse. And this just serves to make our depression worse because we feel lazy and no good. So instead of telling ourselves, “I’ve got to get this whole kitchen cleaned up,” we should break it down and say, the first thing is to unload the dishwasher full of clean dishes. But this is even too much, so we tell ourselves, “okay, the only thing I have to do right now is unload the silverware.” This is a job we can usually get ourselves to do because it’s short and easy and requires only a bit of our valuable energy. Once we’re done with the silverware, we can leave the kitchen and collapse on the couch until the next time we go to the kitchen for something and break off another small chunk by unloading just the bottom portion of the dishwasher. By doing things this way, it allows us to at least get started on our immediate tasks. Granted, it takes a bit longer using this method, but it’s better than not doing anything at all.3. Be Positive about Even the Smallest Victories In mental health recovery, any small step should be celebrated. Use these victories to encourage and remind yourself that you can indeed overcome one step at a time. You’ll be able to say, “I know I can do it because I’ve done it before.” When depression causes a lack of motivation, know that you can still beat it.Your parents could stipulate that he cannot continue to live in the house if he refuses help, and this may act as leverage into getting him into to see a counselor. Your family can also consider seeing a family therapist and getting his or her guidance on how to live with a family member who is clearly in need of help but is not motivated to get it (if this ends up being the case). Maybe your brother would be interested in participating in the family therapy; this would be encouraging.Talk to your brother as a family, maybe try bringing his friends into the situation and suggest that he talk to a counselor. Best of luck to you and your family."
"I’ve been dating him for 5 months now and I truly love him. He was brought up in a middle class environment but struggled when growing up because of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He has a job as an apprentice engineer and he has said he will often have angry outbursts at work if he gets something wrong and will hurt himself by punching steel or whatever is nearby. He has extreme beliefs like he will own a particular city one day and change things to suit his “ideal”. He has extreme beliefs that all murders and rapists should be killed (he lives in UK). He comes across quite shy when talking to people (I’m not just saying this cause he’s my boyfriend but he’s really attractive conventionally so you’d think he’d be more confident); he will willingly talk to people but not make much eye contact. He gets very paranoid that I will cheat on him and says if I ever do I’ll never see him again and he says I’m the only person he loves and he wants to marry me in the future even although we’ve only been dating 5 months. He can be quite controlling and doesn’t like me smoking (he caught me smoking at a party and had a random shouting outburst at his friend when he tried to intervene). Last night when we were at his mum’s house he told her everything about him feeling angry at the slightest thing and he started crying cause I’m the only one he’s ever told about these feelings. He says I am the only thing that makes him happy, but he thinks I’m too naive and always wants to be there to protect me always because he always thinks the worst of people he doesn’t know. I’m really concerned and his mum and I suggested he see a counselor even although he really doesn’t want to. His mum thinks he has depression?? What do you think it could be?",,"I admire your concern about your boyfriend. But while I have some ideas about what might be going on, it isn’t possible to make a diagnosis in this manner. What I will say is that you are right to have a concern. My encouragement is to suggest he get an evaluation by a psychiatrist or to have some testing by a psychologist, preferably one with experience in neuropsychology. Only in this way can an accurate diagnosis and recommendation for treatment be made.Until then, protect yourself by not allowing his needs to eclipse your own. Be clear about setting boundaries, and make the suggestion for an evaluation. But most importantly don’t lose yourself in the effort to help him. Ultimately he has to want the change to take place, and that is something he has to do on his own.Wishing you patience and peace,"
"I met my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago online. He is in the army and was soon to be sent to Afghanistan. He lived about 6 hours away from me but being that we just met I decided not to visit (for safety reasons). Once he was sent away, we became very close, we scheduled web cam dates, sent letters, emails, cards, etc.",,"It’s really, really important to remember that you are the adult and she is the child. You are not competing with her for your boyfriend’s attention. You need adult attention. She needs the love and attention every child needs.I do not think this child is jealous. I think she is traumatized. She is only two and has lost her mother. Separating her from her mom may absolutely be the right thing to do but a little baby doesn’t have any way to understand that. All she knows is that her mother has gone away. It sounds to me like she is clinging to her daddy because, in her baby way, she doesn’t want to lose him too. You and your boyfriend need to talk to a therapist who can help you learn how to help this little girl feel more secure. If you two go forward in this relationship, you will need to do some serious work together for her to understand and learn to relax and to accept you into the family.In the meantime, go slow. You are not going to be able to turn this situation around during a visit so it’s better to not push for change. Start out by just being a friendly person in their lives. She needs time to learn that you are not a threat. You and your boyfriend need time to learn what it’s like when you are on the same couch, not on line. By all means, wait for your turn for your boyfriend’s affection when she is napping or in bed for the night.Please be patient with the situation. Going slow now will pay off in the future.I wish you well."
"let's talk about self-care. In your experience, what self-care activities or habits are beneficial for promoting mental well-being?",,Self-care is essential for maintaining mental and emotional health. Some self-care activities and habits that can be particularly beneficial include:
"I want to go back to my ex-husband from whom I’ve been divorced for over three years because of his violence. Before the divorce he ended up in jail for almost a year for domestic abuse. Since his release he says he’s changed. He’s gone to a local community mental health facility, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and adult ADHD. He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances. I see him on a regular basis and realize we still love each other, although it’s hard to believe that he loved me when he was abusive, which I now attribute to mental illness. The problem is threefold:",,It sounds to me like you already have a reasonable solution. You don’t have to marry in order to be friends and lovers. You have more to lose than to gain by giving in to his demands to somehow prove to him that you are there for him. What concerns me most is that he asserts he is the only one who truly loves you. These are the words of a potential abuser. Love isn’t about isolating someone. It’s not about making someone feel they can’t be loved by others. Real love is generous and kind. I hope you don’t believe that he’s the only one who cares. Your sons certainly love you and are protective of you when you aren’t protective of yourself. It’s one thing to “accept” him as he is. It’s another to cave in to unreasonable and selfish demands. I hope you will trust your intuition.I wish you well.
"I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one. My parents divorced when I was nine and he immediately found a new girlfriend. They’ve been together ever since. I didn’t mind and actually liked the new family (she has a daughter my age), but when they moved in together I was never included as a part of the family and was treated as a “second-class citizen” by my stepmother. My father did nothing about this and usually took her side (albeit reluctantly) in order to avoid conflict because she threw fits if she didn’t get her way. I wasn’t allowed to use the nicest things in the house and was never allowed to be “better” than my stepsister–if the two of us came downstairs in similar outfits, I would be the one who had to go change. When I got a perfect score on the SATs, I wasn’t allowed to mention it because she didn’t do as well. These things seem trivial, and they are, but the gradual accumulation of this kind of thing over the years led me to resent him. I used to have pretty bad problems with depression–I lost 20 lbs in a month, my mood swung back and forth from hysterical to empty, I experienced dissociative episodes, self-medicated with drugs and I spent all my free time in bed, only coming out for meals. My dad didn’t ever acknowledge this and I feel like he was willfully ignorant about a lot of other things going on in my life. He never asked me about drinking, drugs, boyfriends, friends, and any difficulties I might be having and he never praised anything I did. I feel like I’m making him out to be a bad person, which he isn’t, but he just doesn’t want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he’d rather ignore it. He also (until I was in college) treated me like a child–I wasn’t allowed to hear bad words and he’d be obviously uncomfortable if I interacted in an equal way with adults in front of him. When he and his girlfriend temporarily broke up he became incredibly affectionate, which really upset me since he had consistently chosen his girlfriend over me for the past five years. He also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when I was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because I don’t eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction). He made fun of me for being a hypochondriac and continues to make hypochondriac jokes even when it’s really not funny–but that’s more of his denial and refusal to admit that things actually might be serious.",,"This sounds awful. I am genuinely sorry that you had to go through all of this in your family. But I don’t think completely shutting him out is the best approach. I believe what is needed is a change in expectation and attitude.Your father has been systematically disappointing to you and you were not able to get what you needed from him when you needed it. This is sad and unfortunate, but trying to get now what you needed back then isn’t going to work. The time for him to be more engaged in your upbringing has come and gone.This means that you can grieve what you didn’t have with your father and stop looking for him to be what he wasn’t and can no longer be.In grieving a time gone by it can open you to connecting in a way that is more suitable to your needs now. Occasional contact can be fine with lowered expectations. As a young adult the emphasis in your life is shifting to meeting your own needs in relationships and intimacy. You can detach with compassion from the childhood needs from your dad, and allow for something else to emerge.You obviously have the intellectual ability to succeed in life; this is your chance to develop the emotional growth that was limited in your childhood.Focus now on finding the people in your life that will support and nurture you (as you do them) as you move forward. The counseling center at your university can offer you some support as you go through this transition.Wishing you patience and peace,"
"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.",Depression,"Depending on your relationship with your parents, inviting them to have a conversation might be a good first step. &nbsp;If they consent then you can have the opportunity to discuss your concerns with them. &nbsp;Inviting someone to a conversation and getting their agreement is a great first step. I would then make sure your location of the discussion is conducive to the conversation and once all that is considered it might be beneficial that you make a list of your concerns prior to the meeting. &nbsp;this can help keep you on point.&nbsp;"
