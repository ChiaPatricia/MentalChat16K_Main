I used to cut in the past but got help and medication (Zoloft). I cannot stop hitting myself and slamming my head against walls. I have taken quizzes for things such a bipolar disorder and have scored a high number. Yet, the quizzes are not helpful because the questions are hard to answer when you are feeling many different emotions. My boyfriend is always worried about me because I often get extremely irritated, which is when I start to hurt myself. I’m just not sure where to go from here.","Self-harm may indicate that: (1) you lack effective problem-solving skills and or; (2) you are unhappy with your life. Happy people don’t engage in self-harm. It simply doesn’t cross their minds.The path to self-harm is precipitated by strong emotions. People who engage in self-harm might do so because they don’t possess good coping skills. They’re searching for a release. Perhaps the physical sensation that accompanies self-harm provides them with some relief but it’s short-lived. It will always make the situation worse.Have you explored why you continually find yourself experiencing strong emotions? We all occasionally experience strong emotions but it should not be an everyday occurrence. Our mood can be impacted by lack of sleep, medication, hormones, among other things but day-to-day, it should be stable. If your emotions were more stable, you might feel less driven to engage in self-harm.Self-harm is often the result of self-directed blame and anger. If you’re willing to hurt yourself, then you must believe that you deserve pain and suffering. You don’t; no one does.Many people who engage in self-harm also report feeling unworthy and lacking self-esteem. That type of self-defeating thinking is often irrational and illogical.You have a history of seeking help. That’s promising. It shows that you are open to treatment. My advice is to consult a therapist. Medication might also be helpful but you will need to review that decision with your treating professionals.You don’t have to suffer. Help is available. All you have to do is decide to seek help. I hope you will make the right choice. Please take care."

","I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.","Since it is clear that people react differently to the same&nbsp;stressors, we know that the stressors are not causing the anxiety, our thoughts about the stressors are. Often, cognitive distortions are the problem. Some common cognitive distortions include catastrophizing (predicting the worst), future telling, black and white thinking (if it's not perfect, it's terrible), mind-reading (I just know he is angry at me) and can't-standitis (I can't stand this situation). There are more, but the list is long, and if some of these are resonating with you, I would advise looking up CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) tips, worksheets, booklets etc. on line, or contact a local CBT therapist. Another helpful piece of info on anxiety, is that it is prone to something called ""symptom stress"" - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like, ""Oh no I'm getting nervous about this, I'm getting uptight, I look nervous, what if I have a panic attack!"" followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;more cognitive distortions such as ""I can't stand being anxious!"" and ""this is horrible!""&nbsp;The&nbsp;antidote to this is acceptance.&nbsp; Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon Kabat-Zinn). If you happen to feel anxious, say to yourself - this is just a reaction I'm having that is unpleasant, but not horrible. I can tolerate and survive some anxiety, I can breathe deeply,&nbsp;and I'll be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.We can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk, and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. We have the ability to think about our thinking, decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy, and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking, and according to self-perception theory, "" we learn what we&nbsp;believe when we hear ourselves speak,"" so we may as well be a calming, reassuring presence in our own minds. :)"

","When already in the ‘possible divorce’ zone does a husband forgetting your anniversary mean he might not love you? Me and my husband have had a rocky relationship but lately it has escalated to the point of talking about separating or divorce. 7 months after the wedding I found out he was having an affair with an ex. When confronted he blamed me and treated me very harshly. We ended up staying together but he would never speak of his infedelity really which has caused 8 years of questions, fears, and continuous pain for me. About a month ago I reached a point where I no longer cared about his reaction, I just needed answers! He admitted to a few things, one of which was having an affair with the same woman a year before we got married when we were having problems. I had accused him of this for 9 years but he denied it vehemently and made me feel horrible for even thinking it. Lying for 9 years using the same face, tone of voice, and sincerity that he uses when he says he loves me has left me with a lot of confusion and fear. On top of that our sex life has never recovered and not for lack of trying on my part.","It sounds to me like you aren’t really sure what you want. You say that you’re already in the divorce zone. This man has lied to you, cheated on you, and isn’t interested in being intimate with you. He has only honored the usual occasions for showing love and caring when you have prompted and begged. And yet you say you NEED him to remember an anniversary of a marriage that has never been particularly good and that doesn’t look promising for the future. Is it possible that you are so scared to finally cut the cord that you are grasping at straws? Will it really be enough for you to stay married if he comes up with gifts and flowers now and then but you can’t trust him?I suggest you stop asking yourself if he loves you and instead ask yourself if his kind of love is the kind of love you want to accept for the rest of your life. I hope you love yourself enough to believe you deserve better.I wish you well."

",I noticed that I tend to avoid eye contact with others whether they are good friends of mine or a family member. I try to but always feel my eyes wet and irritated. Most of the times I can’t hold a normal conversation (I talk to others but not as much as I’d like to) and feel that I’m lacking concentration or don’t give enough attention to others and what they are telling me. On the other hand I often wake up feeling down(sad) and actually don’t want to communicate with anyone else. I used to think I’m just a shy person but I realised it could be something more. I’m 19 so shouldn’t it be like a second nature to me?,"You try to make eye contact but your eyes are “wet and irritated.” This might indicate an eye problem rather than a social problem. Wet and irritated eyes might be the result of allergies or other eye problems. It would be wise to consult a physician to determine what might be wrong.You also described feeling sad and not wanting to communicate with others. Those might be signs of depression. People who are depressed tend to isolate. They want to connect with others but their depression makes it difficult to do so.I’m not certain what you meant by this question: “I’m 19 so shouldn’t it be second nature to me?” Are you asking if it should be “second nature” to be conversational because of your age? Perhaps you are wanting to know if you “should” be more conversational because you’re young. Age and being a good conversationalist are not necessarily correlated.It is possible, based on the limited information provided, that you may have symptoms of depression. If that were to be the case, then it might explain why you are having difficulty connecting with others. Relatedly, your wet and irritated eyes might indicate allergies or other medical problems. If that were true it might explain why you your inability to maintain eye contact. Both of these issues should be investigated. They are easily corrected with the assistance of professionals: a physician for your eyes and a therapist for your mood issues. With the right treatment, these problems can be eliminated. Good luck with your efforts. Please take care."

We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she’s away seeing her parents because my grandma’s going into surgery soon. Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn. It could be that he listens to my mum or that she does it usually and dad hasn’t had to do the washing up more than once every few days. I think it’s a bit of both.","It isn’t your responsibility to look after the whole family while your mom’s away. Everyone needs to do their part — and it sounds like you are acting more like a mom than a daughter with your father. I would ask how you can help him rather than only try to help on your own. At dinner time you might be better able to influence if you did it by example rather than telling him what to do. Ask how you can help and wash your hands as you invite your dad to do so as well. Everyone is under stress while your mom is gone — don’t feel you have to answer for everyone and everything — just do your part.Wishing you patience and peace,"

The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions. ","Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the&nbsp;autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response).&nbsp; This system is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.&nbsp; It is largely an unconscious function, but with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare and cope for larger presentations.&nbsp; One of the greatest applications of addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the challenge with success.&nbsp; You can learn more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with it.     With that being said, finding a program like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help.&nbsp; Working with a counselor who can help you utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as well. Good luck!"

I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like  they just want nothing to do with me.",As long as you try to reach others expectations you will never feel satisfied or accepted.&nbsp; How about setting your own expectations for self and strive for those.&nbsp; Make sure your expectations are reachable and realistic.

The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions. ","I have seen my therapist for several years and she has been extremely helpful. Despite the number of years we have worked together, I still find opening up with her and sharing certain feelings or thoughts extremely difficult. Part of this is due to the fact that I have a hard time identifying my feelings and describing them. My therapist on the other hand is so insightful and can nail my feelings down with her questioning. I am very thankful she is able to do this (and also amazed at her ability to find the right word to help describe how I feel).","The only way for therapy to really be effective is to be totally open and honest with your therapist, so you need to let her know about your sadness and what has been happening to you during your sessions the last few months. She is there to help you, it is her job, so you shouldn’t worry about the effect you have on her, because it is also her job to know how to take care of herself as a helping professional. She’s human so she might occasionally show emotional reactions to your stories, but I would suggest that this is just evidence that she is really “there” with you. It is not something that should cause shame or embarrassment.It sounds like you and your therapist have a good connection. Be honest with her about your concerns and refocus on your own healing rather than worrying about the effect you have on her. And finally, if you feel that you are too connected to your therapist to focus on your own healing, it’s probably time to find a new therapist.All the best,"

The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions. ","My fiance and I are in a long distance relationship. We were dating and engaged for 4 years before I broke up with him and relocated across county. We have now been back together a year but the demons from the past are cropping up again. We do fight, sometimes vehemently when it comes to how I choose to spend my free time. It was like this in the past. I’ve been a bit of a hermit the past year and, at his urging, he tells me to find friends and find things to do. I mention to him, a female co-worker and I were chatting about our love of cooking. She mentioned she throws a dinner party once in awhile and I said I’d love to go.","You are 35 years old, yet your fiance is treating you like a teenager who has no judgment. You’re correct. He is setting too many boundaries. It seems like all you have to do is even think about attending an art exhibit or dinner party and his mind creates a story about you getting swept up in inappropriate things. He says you are too dominant yet he thinks you are so weak you can’t make good decisions.I don’t see anything good coming out of this. You’ve never violated his trust but he acts as if you can’t be trusted at all. This isn’t a problem of communication. He is so insecure that the only way he feels comfortable in the relationship is by isolating you. Nothing you can say or do is going to change this. He needs serious therapy. I suggest you take a break from this relationship until he does some serious personal work and proves to you that he doesn’t have to limit you to feel okay.I wish you well. |"
