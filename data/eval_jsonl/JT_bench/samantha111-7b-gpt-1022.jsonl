One approach is to discourage sneaking food between meals, as it can lead to restriction and anxiety. Instead, the family can unobtrusively reduce the patient's access to the kitchen, making it easier for her to focus on her meals without feeling tempted to sneak food.\n\nAdditionally, encouraging the patient's interest in menu planning, food magazines, and cooking lessons can be helpful. Leaving information and materials around the house can provide opportunities for the patient to learn about different types of food and engage in activities related to food preparation. This approach allows the patient to take control of her own meals while still maintaining a sense of independence.\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, permitting the patient to eat her meals privately in her bedroom might actually hinder her progress. By encouraging family preoccupation with meals, it can create an environment where the patient feels pressured or judged during mealtimes. Instead, suggesting that the patient joins in routine family meals and clears the dishes after dinner can help foster a sense of connection and normalcy within the family dynamic.\n\nRemember, every individual is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another.
