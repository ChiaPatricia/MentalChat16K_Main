It's great that you're exercising, but it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.\n\nGiven that you've ruled out medical causes, it's worth exploring the possibility of depression as a contributing factor. Depression can manifest in different ways, and not everyone experiences it the same way. It's important to remember that feeling tired, lacking motivation, and not enjoying things you used to enjoy can be symptoms of depression. It's also worth noting that depression can sometimes be accompanied by anxiety, which can disrupt sleep and contribute to fatigue.\n\nTo better understand if you're experiencing depression, it might be helpful to reflect on other symptoms commonly associated with depression. These can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, and trouble sleeping or waking up. It's important to remember that experiencing some of these symptoms doesn't necessarily mean you have depression, but it's worth exploring further.\n\nTo gain more insight into your mental health, it could be beneficial to keep a journal or track your mood and energy levels throughout the day. This can help identify patterns and potential triggers for your fatigue and low mood. Additionally, consider reaching out to trusted friends or loved ones for support. Sometimes talking about our experiences can provide valuable insights and help us better understand ourselves.\n\nIf you're comfortable, discussing your feelings with a mental health professional could be beneficial. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and guide you through the process of understanding and managing your symptoms.

This can help make it feel more automatic and reduce any resistance you may have.\n\n2.

Sharing your feelings and concerns with someone you trust can provide you with a sense of understanding and encouragement.\n\n4. Educate yourself: Learn more about your medication and its benefits. Understanding how it works and how it can improve your daily life may help alleviate any negative thoughts or feelings associated with taking it.\n\n5.

It's also important to find healthy coping mechanisms to deal with your anxiety.  When it comes to grounding techniques, there are several you can try. One technique involves using your senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. You can focus on five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This exercise helps to redirect your attention away from anxious thoughts and into the present.  Another technique you can try is deep breathing exercises. When we're anxious, our breathing tends to become shallow and rapid. By taking slow, deep breaths, we can activate the relaxation response in our bodies. You can try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a count of four, and exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this several times until you start to feel more calm.  It's also important to take care of yourself physically. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating balanced meals, and engaging in regular exercise. Physical activity can help to reduce anxiety symptoms.
