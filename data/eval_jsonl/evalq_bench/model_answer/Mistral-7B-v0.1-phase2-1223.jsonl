It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and there are strategies you can try to help manage your anxiety.\n\nOne technique that might be helpful is deep breathing exercises. When you notice yourself starting to feel anxious, take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce feelings of anxiety.\n\nAnother strategy you could try is grounding techniques. These involve bringing your attention to the present moment and your physical surroundings. For example, you could try focusing on the sensations in your feet as you walk or the texture of an object in your hand. Engaging your senses in this way can help distract your mind from anxious thoughts.\n\nAdditionally, it may be beneficial to explore any underlying causes or triggers for your anxiety. Reflect on any past experiences or patterns that may contribute to your anxiety when waiting for guests. Understanding these factors can provide insight into why you feel this way and help guide your therapy sessions.\n\nIn terms of managing anxiety during social situations, it can be helpful to practice self-care and self-compassion. Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to feel anxious. Remember, you're doing your best, and seeking support is a courageous step.\n\nLastly, consider reaching out to your support system. Talk to trusted friends or family members about your anxiety and how it impacts you. Sometimes, simply sharing your feelings with someone who cares can provide a sense of relief.\n\nRemember, managing anxiety takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself as you explore different strategies and techniques. If your anxiety persists or worsens, it may be beneficial to discuss these concerns with your therapist or doctor.
