It's important to recognize that self-harm is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it's not uncommon for people to experience a range of emotions and thoughts when dealing with it. I'm glad you've sought help in the past and are currently taking medication.

The first step in addressing self-harm is to create a safe and supportive environment for you to discuss your feelings and thoughts. This can involve seeking professional help from a mental health counsellor or therapist who specializes in working with self-harm behaviors. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your self-harm and develop strategies to cope with these emotions in a healthier way.

In addition to professional support, there are several self-help strategies you can try:

1. Mindfulness: Practicing mindfulness can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions in the present moment, allowing you to better manage your feelings and urges to self-harm.
2. Grounding techniques: Engaging in grounding exercises, such as deep breathing, squeezing a stress ball, or focusing on a specific object, can help you regain a sense of control and stability when you feel overwhelmed.
3. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This therapy can help you identify and challenge negative thought patterns and beliefs that contribute to self-harm behaviors.
4. Self-compassion: Treating yourself with kindness and understanding can help you develop a more positive self-image and reduce feelings of shame and guilt associated with self-harm.

As you work on these strategies, it's important to remember that healing from self-harm takes time and patience. Be gentle with yourself, and don't be discouraged if you experience setbacks. It's essential to have a support system in place, such as friends, family, or a support group, to help you navigate this journey.

I'm here to support you and help you through this process. If you'd like to discuss any of these strategies further or need additional guidance, please don't hesitate to reach out."," It sounds like you've been going through a really tough time lately, and I want to assure you that there are resources available to support you. It's great that you reached out for help in the past and received medication and therapy. While quizzes can be helpful in gaining some insight into certain conditions, it's important to remember that they should not replace professional diagnosis or treatment.

If you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure where to go from here, it might be beneficial to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance and support. They can help you explore your feelings and experiences more deeply, and work with you to develop coping strategies and techniques to manage your self-harm urges.

In the meantime, there are some steps you can take to prioritize your well-being. Firstly, consider finding healthy outlets for your emotions, such as journaling, drawing, or engaging in creative activities. These can provide an alternative way to express yourself and process your emotions.

Additionally, building a strong support system is crucial. Reach out to trusted friends or family members who can offer understanding and encouragement during difficult times. Sometimes, talking to someone you trust about what you're going through can make a significant difference.

Remember to take care of yourself physically as well. Engage in regular exercise, eat nutritious meals, and ensure you're getting enough sleep. Taking care of your physical health can positively impact your mental well-being.

Lastly, if you ever find yourself in immediate danger or feel unable to keep yourself safe, please don't hesitate to reach out to emergency services or contact a helpline specifically designed for crisis situations. Your safety is paramount, and there are people available to assist you in those moments.

Please know that you're not alone in this journey, and there are people who genuinely care about your well-being. Seeking professional help is a brave step towards finding the support and guidance you deserve."

It's essential to address the various aspects of your life that contribute to your anxiety. Here are some strategies to help you manage your anxiety:
1. Prioritize self-care: Make sure you're taking care of your physical and mental health by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly.
2. Set realistic goals: Break down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps, and focus on completing one task at a time.
3. Practice mindfulness: Learn to be present in the moment and observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment.
4. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a mental health professional about your concerns and feelings.
5. Develop a stress management plan: Identify your stress triggers and create a plan to cope with them effectively.

Remember, it's essential to be patient with yourself as you work through these strategies."," It can be overwhelming to have anxieties about various aspects of your life, such as finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way and there are steps you can take to manage your anxieties.

Firstly, it might be helpful to prioritize and break down your concerns into smaller, more manageable tasks. By doing this, you can focus on one aspect at a time and create a plan of action. For example, if finances are a major source of stress, you could start by creating a budget or seeking advice from a financial advisor.

Additionally, finding healthy coping mechanisms can greatly assist in managing anxiety. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, can help reduce stress levels. Taking breaks and practicing self-care are also essential for maintaining your well-being.

When it comes to work-related anxieties, consider setting realistic expectations for yourself and communicating any concerns or challenges with your supervisor or colleagues. Open lines of communication can often lead to solutions or support systems that alleviate stress.

Regarding relationships, it may be beneficial to open up lines of communication and express your feelings and needs to those close to you. Healthy relationships require understanding and empathy from both sides, and seeking support from trusted individuals can provide valuable insights and perspectives.

When it comes to kids and household maintenance, remember that you don't have to do everything alone. Reach out to family members, friends, or community resources that can offer assistance or guidance. Delegating tasks and asking for help can lighten your load and create more balance in your life.

Lastly, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional who can provide personalized strategies and support tailored to your specific situation. They can help you navigate through these anxieties and develop effective coping mechanisms.

Remember, managing anxieties takes time and effort, but by implementing these suggestions and seeking support, you can gradually reduce the impact of stress on your daily life."
"When already in the ‘possible divorce’ zone does a husband forgetting your anniversary mean he might not love you? Me and my husband have had a rocky relationship but lately it has escalated to the point of talking about separating or divorce. 7 months after the wedding I found out he was having an affair with an ex. When confronted he blamed me and treated me very harshly. We ended up staying together but he would never speak of his infedelity really which has caused 8 years of questions, fears, and continuous pain for me. About a month ago I reached a point where I no longer cared about his reaction, I just needed answers! He admitted to a few things, one of which was having an affair with the same woman a year before we got married when we were having problems. I had accused him of this for 9 years but he denied it vehemently and made me feel horrible for even thinking it.

It's not uncommon for people to experience a wide range of emotions during times of stress and uncertainty. It's important to remember that each person's experience is unique and that there may be a combination of factors contributing to the challenges you're facing.

When it comes to your husband's actions, it's essential to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. It's possible that his behavior is a result of his own personal struggles, which may have been exacerbated by the infidelity. It's important to recognize that healing and growth can take time, and it's essential to give yourself and your husband the space and support needed to work through these issues.

As for your relationship, it's crucial to remember that forgiveness and healing can be a gradual process. It's not uncommon for trust to be rebuilt over time, and it's important to give yourself and your husband the opportunity to work through these issues together.

Regarding your husband's reaction to your accusations, it's important to understand that people often react defensively when they feel threatened or cornered. It's essential to approach the situation with empathy and understanding, and to try to find common ground for healing and growth.

In terms of your sex life, it's important to remember that intimacy can be a delicate and complex aspect of any relationship. It's essential to give yourselves the time and space needed to rebuild trust and intimacy, and to be patient with yourselves and each other.

It's also helpful to seek professional support from a mental health counsellor or therapist. They can help you navigate these complex emotions and work through the challenges you're facing."," It sounds like you've been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that you're feeling confused and fearful. It can be incredibly difficult when trust is broken, especially after being together for such a long time.

Firstly, I want to acknowledge the pain and hurt you've experienced due to your husband's infidelity. It takes a lot of strength to confront these issues and seek answers. Remember that healing takes time, and it's important to prioritize your own well-being throughout this process.

When it comes to rebuilding trust, communication is key. Open and honest conversations about your feelings, concerns, and expectations can help create a safe space for both of you to express yourselves. It may be helpful to set boundaries and establish clear guidelines for rebuilding trust, such as transparency and accountability from your husband.

Additionally, consider seeking support from friends, family, or even a therapist who can provide guidance and help you navigate through this challenging time. They can offer an outside perspective and provide emotional support as you work towards healing and rebuilding your relationship.

Remember, every relationship is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Take things at your own pace and focus on what feels right for you. Trust yourself and trust that you have the strength to make decisions that are best for your well-being.

It's not uncommon for people to experience feelings of shyness or social anxiety, especially in social situations. It's important to recognize that these feelings can be a normal part of life and that they don't necessarily define you.

To help you better understand and manage your social anxiety, I'd suggest the following steps:

1. Identify your triggers: Try to pinpoint the situations or environments that cause you the most anxiety. This can help you develop strategies to cope with those specific situations.
2. Practice deep breathing: When feeling anxious, practice deep breathing exercises to help calm your mind and body.
3. Gradually expose yourself: Gradually expose yourself to the situations that cause you anxiety, starting with smaller, less stressful environments. As you become more comfortable, gradually increase the level of challenge.
4. Develop coping skills: Practice self-talk, mindfulness, and positive self-talk to help manage your anxiety and maintain a positive mindset.
5. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a mental health professional about your experiences and feelings. Sharing your thoughts and feelings can help you feel less alone and provide valuable insights.

Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself as you work through these steps. It's normal to experience setbacks and challenges along the way, but with persistence and dedication, you can improve your social skills and confidence."," It's great that you're recognizing and reflecting on your experiences with avoiding eye contact. It can be challenging to navigate social interactions, especially when it affects your ability to engage in conversations and feel connected with others.

While it's normal to have some shyness as a personality trait, it sounds like your feelings of sadness and discomfort may be indicative of something more. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and what might feel ""normal"" for one person may not be the same for another.

Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member who you feel comfortable talking to about your concerns. Sharing your thoughts and emotions with someone supportive can provide valuable insights and help you gain a better understanding of yourself.

Additionally, exploring self-help resources such as books or online articles on building confidence and improving social skills could be beneficial. These resources often offer practical strategies and techniques to overcome shyness and improve communication skills.

If you find that these strategies aren't providing the desired results, seeking guidance from a mental health professional could be another option worth considering. They can provide personalized support and help you navigate through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of sadness and difficulty with eye contact.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and support when needed. You deserve to feel comfortable and connected in your relationships, and there are resources available to assist you on this journey."
"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she’s away seeing her parents because my grandma’s going into surgery soon. Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn. It could be that he listens to my mum or that she does it usually and dad hasn’t had to do the washing up more than once every few days. I think it’s a bit of both.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

Your description of your dad's cooking habits and the resulting tension between you and him highlights a common issue that many people face in their relationships with others. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique way of interacting with the world, and that includes your dad.

One approach to addressing this issue is to practice empathy and understanding. Instead of focusing on your dad's shortcomings, try to see the situation from his perspective. Consider that he may have certain habits or preferences that make him feel comfortable in the kitchen.

Another approach is to set boundaries and communicate your expectations clearly. You can express your concerns in a calm and respectful manner, while also acknowledging that everyone has different ways of doing things.

For example, you could say something like, ""I understand that you have your own way of doing things, but I'm concerned about the health and cleanliness of our kitchen. I'd appreciate it if you could take a few extra minutes to wash your hands and clean the kitchen properly, so that we can all enjoy our meals without worrying about germs.""

By approaching the situation with empathy and understanding, while also setting boundaries, you might be able to find a compromise that works for both you and your dad."," It sounds like you have a good relationship with your dad and you both share many common interests. However, it seems that there is a disconnect when it comes to certain aspects of hygiene in the kitchen. While you may not be too bothered by germs, it's important to prioritize cleanliness for the sake of your sister's and your own health.

Instead of confronting your dad directly, you could try approaching the issue from a different angle. You might find it helpful to explain to him that you care about his and your family's well-being and want to ensure that the kitchen is clean and safe for everyone. You could emphasize the importance of proper hygiene practices in preventing illnesses or infections.

You could also suggest finding a routine together that includes regular cleaning tasks. This way, he can feel more involved and have a sense of ownership over the process. You can create a checklist or schedule together, so he knows what needs to be done and when. By involving him in the process, it may help him understand the importance of these tasks and make him more likely to follow through.

Additionally, consider finding alternative ways to contribute to the cleaning process. For example, you could offer to help him wash the dishes or wipe down surfaces after he cooks. This way, you can work together towards a clean kitchen while still respecting his autonomy.

Remember, communication is key in any relationship, including parent-child relationships. By expressing your concerns and finding common ground, you can work towards a healthier and cleaner kitchen environment."

It's not uncommon to feel anxious or nervous in social situations. One way to cope with this anxiety is to practice deep breathing exercises. When you're feeling anxious, take a few slow, deep breaths, focusing on your breath as it enters and exits your body. This can help calm your mind and body, and may help you feel more prepared for the situation."," It can be really challenging to experience such intense physical and emotional symptoms when speaking in public or in large crowds. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, as many people struggle with similar anxieties. While I'm not a professional, I can offer some suggestions that might help you manage these feelings:

1. Deep breathing exercises: When you start to feel overwhelmed, try taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help regulate your breathing and calm your body down.

2. Gradual exposure: Consider gradually exposing yourself to situations that make you anxious. Start with smaller, less intimidating crowds or audiences, and gradually work your way up to larger ones. By facing your fears in a controlled manner, you can build confidence and reduce anxiety over time.

3. Visualize success: Before an event, take a moment to imagine yourself speaking confidently and comfortably in front of the audience. Visualization techniques can help rewire your brain to associate public speaking with positive emotions rather than fear.

4. Practice relaxation techniques: Find relaxation techniques that work for you, such as progressive muscle relaxation or guided imagery. These practices can help relax your body and mind, making it easier to manage anxiety symptoms.

5. Seek support: Consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mentor who can provide encouragement and reassurance before and during public speaking events. Having someone supportive by your side can make a significant difference in managing anxiety.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, so it may take time and patience to find what works best for you. If these strategies don't seem to alleviate your anxiety, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional who can provide personalized support and assistance."

It's important to recognize that feelings of inadequacy can stem from various factors, including comparing oneself to others or feeling overwhelmed by expectations. To address these feelings, it's essential to practice self-compassion and self-care. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Practice mindfulness: Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This can help you become more aware of your emotions and better understand their origins.
2. Set realistic expectations: Acknowledge that you cannot please everyone, and strive to set achievable goals for yourself.
3. Cultivate self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend.
4. Seek support: Share your feelings with a trusted friend or mental health professional who can offer guidance and encouragement.

Remember, it's not uncommon to feel inadequate at times. The key is to recognize these feelings and take steps to address them."," It can be really tough when you feel like you're constantly falling short of others' expectations and it seems like they're not fully satisfied with your work. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and abilities, and what may not meet someone else's expectations might still be valuable in other ways. 

One suggestion I have is to focus on your own growth and development. Take some time to reflect on your skills, strengths, and areas where you feel you could improve. By identifying these areas, you can work towards developing them and becoming more confident in your abilities. This self-awareness can help you better understand your own worth and value.

Another helpful approach could be to communicate openly with the people who ask you to do things. Express your concerns and fears about not meeting their expectations. They may not even realize how you're feeling or the pressure you're under. By having an open conversation, you can both gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and find potential solutions together.

Additionally, consider setting boundaries and learning to say no when necessary. Sometimes we take on tasks that stretch us too thin or that we're not fully equipped to handle. It's okay to recognize your limitations and prioritize your well-being. By saying no when appropriate, you're allowing yourself the space to focus on tasks that align with your skills and passions.

Lastly, remember that everyone has their own insecurities and doubts. It's not uncommon to feel unsure about our abilities at times. Surrounding yourself with supportive and understanding individuals who appreciate your efforts can make a big difference. Seek out relationships with people who believe in you and your capabilities, and surround yourself with a positive support system.

I hope these suggestions help you navigate through this challenging situation. Remember, you are valuable and deserving of recognition and appreciation for the efforts you put into things."

It's wonderful to hear that you have a strong connection with your therapist and that she has been able to help you in so many ways. Opening up and sharing your feelings can be challenging, but it's important to remember that the process of self-discovery and growth is a journey.

One suggestion for improving your ability to identify and describe your feelings is to practice mindfulness and self-awareness. This can involve paying attention to your thoughts, emotions, and bodily sensations in the present moment without judgment. By cultivating this awareness, you can gain a deeper understanding of your feelings and their origins, which can make it easier to express them in a more accurate and nuanced way.

Another approach to improving your emotional intelligence is to practice active listening. When engaging in conversations with others, try to truly listen to their thoughts and feelings, without interrupting or formulating your response. This can help you develop a better understanding of others' emotions and perspectives, which in turn can improve your ability to express your own feelings.

As you continue to work on these skills, you may find that your ability to identify and describe your feelings becomes more natural and effortless. Remember, the process of self-discovery and growth is not always linear, and it's important to be patient with yourself as you navigate this journey."," It's great to hear that you've been working with your therapist for several years and that they have been very helpful to you. It can be challenging to open up and share certain feelings or thoughts, even when we've been seeing someone for a long time. Identifying and describing our emotions can sometimes feel difficult, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of experiencing and expressing their feelings.

One suggestion I have is to try exploring different techniques or exercises that might help you better understand and articulate your emotions. For example, keeping a journal where you write down your thoughts and feelings throughout the day can provide you with a better sense of what you're experiencing. You could also try drawing or creating art as a way to express yourself visually. These activities can sometimes offer new perspectives and insights into your emotions.

Additionally, it might be helpful to reflect on past experiences or situations that trigger certain emotions for you. By identifying patterns or common themes in these triggers, you may gain a better understanding of how certain events affect you emotionally. This self-awareness can be empowering and can contribute to more effective communication with your therapist.

Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, and your therapist is there to support you. If you find it challenging to express your feelings, don't hesitate to discuss this with them. They can provide guidance and suggest strategies that may help you navigate this aspect of therapy.

Overall, I encourage you to continue exploring different ways of understanding and expressing your emotions. With time and practice, it's possible that you'll become more comfortable opening up and sharing your thoughts and feelings with your therapist.

"My fiance and I are in a long distance relationship. We were dating and engaged for 4 years before I broke up with him and relocated across county. We have now been back together a year but the demons from the past are cropping up again. We do fight, sometimes vehemently when it comes to how I choose to spend my free time. It was like this in the past. I’ve been a bit of a hermit the past year and, at his urging, he tells me to find friends and find things to do. I mention to him, a female co-worker and I were chatting about our love of cooking. She mentioned she throws a dinner party once in awhile and I said I’d love to go.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

It's important to recognize that long-distance relationships can be challenging, and it's not uncommon for past issues to resurface. The key is to address these issues and work together to find solutions.

To help you navigate these challenges, I'd suggest the following:

1. Open communication: Discuss your feelings and concerns with your fiance, and make sure you're both on the same page about your relationship goals and expectations.
2. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries for your time and activities, and make sure both of you understand and respect them.
3. Prioritize quality time: Schedule regular calls, video chats, or visits to spend time together and strengthen your connection.
4. Seek professional help: If needed, consider seeking couples therapy to address any underlying issues or concerns.

Remember, it's not uncommon for couples to experience ups and downs in long-distance relationships. The key is to stay committed to each other and work together to overcome any challenges that arise."," It sounds like you and your fiance have been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that the demons from the past are resurfacing. It's important to address these issues head-on and find ways to work through them together.

Firstly, communication is key. When conflicts arise, try to have an open and honest conversation with your fiance about how you're feeling. Express your concerns about spending time alone and explain that it's a way for you to recharge and find peace. Share with him what activities or hobbies you enjoy doing on your own and why they are important to you.

Additionally, consider finding common ground with your fiance. Perhaps you can explore activities or hobbies that both of you can enjoy together. This could help create opportunities for bonding and spending quality time together.

Building a support network is also crucial. While it may feel uncomfortable at first, reaching out to friends or joining social groups can provide you with a sense of connection and belonging. Surrounding yourself with positive and supportive individuals can make a significant difference in your overall well-being.

Remember, it's okay to have your own interests and passions. Allow yourself to embrace them without feeling guilty or pressured to conform to what others want. Your happiness and fulfillment are important, and finding a balance between your own needs and those of your relationship is essential for a healthy partnership.

Lastly, consider seeking couples therapy if the conflicts persist or become overwhelming. A trained professional can provide guidance and support as you navigate through these challenges together.

Take small steps towards finding a compromise that works for both of you. With patience, understanding, and open communication, you can overcome these difficulties and build a stronger foundation for your relationship."
