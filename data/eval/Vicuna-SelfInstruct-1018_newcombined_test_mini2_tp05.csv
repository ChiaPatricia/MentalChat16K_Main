How did you handle that feeling?"," It's understandable that knowing someone's whereabouts can help you feel more at ease and build trust. However, it's important to remember that trust is a gradual process and there are other factors beyond physical location that contribute to it. Here are some suggestions for addressing this issue:

1. Communication: Instead of solely focusing on knowing someone's address, try engaging in open and honest conversations with them. Ask questions about their interests, values, and experiences. This can help you get to know them better and form a connection.

2. Take it slow: Trust takes time to develop. Allow yourself and the other person to gradually develop a sense of trust through shared activities and interactions. Building trust is not solely dependent on knowing someone's address.

3. Trust your instincts: Pay attention to your gut feelings and intuition. Sometimes, we have a sense of whether someone is trustworthy even if we don't know their exact whereabouts. Trust your instincts and listen to your inner voice.

4. Set boundaries: Establishing clear boundaries can also contribute to building trust. Communicate your needs and expectations early on in the relationship, and ensure that both parties are comfortable with them.

5. Focus on quality time: Instead of solely fixating on finding out someone's address, prioritize spending quality time together. Engage in activities that you both enjoy and create opportunities for meaningful conversations. This can strengthen the connection between you and increase your comfort level.

Remember, trust is a complex issue, and it's essential to approach it with patience and understanding. By focusing on building a strong foundation through communication, taking things slow, trusting your instincts, setting boundaries, and investing in quality time together, you can gradually develop trust with someone new."

"Hi, within the past year I have been hospitalized three times and I have been in two treatment centers.

The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real.

It can be really difficult to navigate these experiences on your own, especially when it feels like no one understands you.

One thing that might be helpful is finding a support system of people who do understand and can provide you with the support you need. This could include friends, family members, or even support groups where you can connect with others who have similar experiences. Having someone to talk to and share your thoughts and feelings with can make a big difference in how you cope with everything.

In addition to seeking support from others, it might also be beneficial to explore different coping strategies and techniques that work for you. Everyone is unique, so what works for one person may not work for another. It could be worth trying out different activities or hobbies that bring you joy or help you relax. Engaging in creative outlets like art, music, or writing can also be a way to express yourself and process your emotions.

While therapy can sometimes be challenging, it can also be a valuable tool in understanding and managing your mental health. If you feel like therapy isn't working for you, it might be worth discussing this with your therapist. They may be able to adjust their approach or suggest alternative therapies that could better suit your needs.

Regarding medication, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your psychiatrist about how it has been affecting you. They can evaluate whether adjustments need to be made or if there are other medication options that might be more suitable for you.

Remember, finding the right path forward takes time and patience. It's okay to feel frustrated and overwhelmed, but don't give up hope. Keep exploring different avenues of support and keep advocating for yourself. You deserve to live a fulfilling and meaningful life, and with the right support and strategies, it is possible to find some relief from the challenges you are facing."

What are some common symptoms of depression in teenagers?

Common symptoms of depression in teenagers may include persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or apathy, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and thoughts of suicide or self-harm.

2. How can I help my brother who may be experiencing depression?

It's important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Encourage open communication and express your concern for his well-being. Offer support and help him access professional resources, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide guidance and treatment tailored to his specific needs. Encourage him to engage in activities he used to enjoy and to consider new interests that may help boost his mood. Remind him that it's okay to ask for help and that he doesn't have to face his challenges alone.

3. What should I do if my brother expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm?

If your brother expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, it's crucial to take these statements seriously and seek help immediately. Encourage him to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor, and inform a trusted adult, such as a family member, friend, or teacher. If he is in immediate danger, contact your local emergency number or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the United States.

4. Can my brother be clinically depressed at 19 years old?

Yes, it is possible for a 19-year-old to experience clinical depression. Depression can affect people of all ages, including teenagers. It's important to take any signs of depression seriously and encourage your brother to seek professional help if needed."," It sounds like your brother is going through a difficult time and it's important to support him. It's not uncommon for teenagers to feel uncertain about their future and have varying interests and priorities. However, if his lack of interest in typical activities is causing him distress and impacting his daily life, it may be helpful to explore what could be contributing to his feelings.

One suggestion is to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with your brother about how he's feeling. Let him know that you care about his well-being and want to understand what's going on. Encourage him to express his thoughts and emotions without fear of judgment.

Additionally, consider reaching out to a trusted adult in his life who can provide guidance and support. This could be a family member, friend, or teacher who can offer a different perspective and help him navigate through this challenging period.

Engaging in activities that bring him joy and fulfillment, even if they don't align with societal expectations, may also be beneficial. Encourage him to explore hobbies or interests that he finds meaningful and allow him to express himself creatively.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it's essential to respect your brother's autonomy and choices. However, if his lack of motivation and disinterest persist or worsen over time, seeking professional help from a mental health expert could be beneficial. They can provide additional guidance and support tailored to his specific needs."
"I’ve been dating him for 5 months now and I truly love him. He was brought up in a middle class environment but struggled when growing up because of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

He can be quite controlling and doesn’t like me smoking (he caught me smoking at a party and had a random shouting outburst at his friend when he tried to intervene).

Based on what you've shared, it's possible that your boyfriend may be experiencing some difficulties related to his upbringing and struggles with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. These factors could contribute to his extreme beliefs and reactions.

Considering his anger outbursts at work and his mention of wanting to change things to suit his ""ideal,"" it may be helpful for him to explore therapy or counseling. A mental health professional can provide guidance and support tailored to his specific needs.

Regarding his controlling behavior towards you, it's important to establish boundaries and open communication in your relationship. Let him know how you feel about his attempts to control your actions and discuss the potential negative impact it could have on your relationship.

As for his fear of you cheating, it's understandable that he might feel insecure given his past experiences. However, it's essential to foster trust and openness between you two. Rebuilding trust takes time and effort from both parties involved. Consider having an honest conversation where you can express your commitment to each other and address any insecurities that may arise.

While his mum's suggestion of counseling is a good step, it's important to respect his decision whether or not he wants to seek professional help. However, if you believe his well-being is at risk, it might be worth having a calm and compassionate conversation with him about the benefits of therapy.

They would need to assess various aspects of his life, including his thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and experiences. If you're concerned about his mental health, encouraging him to consult with a therapist or counselor could be beneficial.

He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances.

2. He's still very volatile and unpredictable.
3. I'm not sure if his mental illness is being managed well enough.

It's understandable that you're considering going back to your ex-husband, but it's important to carefully weigh the risks and benefits before making any decisions. Here are some suggestions to help you navigate this complex situation:

1. Seek professional counseling: Both you and your ex-husband should consider seeing a mental health professional who can help you both better understand and manage your respective conditions. This can help you assess whether his mental illness is being adequately treated and provide guidance on how to cope with his volatility.

4. Consider couples therapy: If you decide to reconcile, consider seeking couples therapy to help you both work through the challenges that come with a history of domestic abuse and mental illness.
5. Monitor his medication compliance: Ensure that your ex-husband is taking his medication as prescribed and that his payee is managing his finances appropriately. This can help you gauge whether his mental illness is being effectively managed.

"I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one. My parents divorced when I was nine and he immediately found a new girlfriend. They’ve been together ever since. I didn’t mind and actually liked the new family (she has a daughter my age), but when they moved in together I was never included as a part of the family and was treated as a “second-class citizen” by my stepmother. My father did nothing about this and usually took her side (albeit reluctantly) in order to avoid conflict because she threw fits if she didn’t get her way. I wasn’t allowed to use the nicest things in the house and was never allowed to be “better” than my stepsister–if the two of us came downstairs in similar outfits, I would be the one who had to go change. When I got a perfect score on the SATs, I wasn’t allowed to mention it because she didn’t do as well. These things seem trivial, and they are, but the gradual accumulation of this kind of thing over the years led me to resent him. I used to have pretty bad problems with depression–I lost 20 lbs in a month, my mood swung back and forth from hysterical to empty, I experienced dissociative episodes, self-medicated with drugs and I spent all my free time in bed, only coming out for meals. My dad didn’t ever acknowledge this and I feel like he was willfully ignorant about a lot of other things going on in my life. He never asked me about drinking, drugs, boyfriends, friends, and any difficulties I might be having and he never praised anything I did. I feel like I’m making him out to be a bad person, which he isn’t, but he just doesn’t want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he’d rather ignore it. He also (until I was in college) treated me like a child–I wasn’t allowed to hear bad words and he’d be obviously uncomfortable if I interacted in an equal way with adults in front of him. When he and his girlfriend temporarily broke up he became incredibly affectionate, which really upset me since he had consistently chosen his girlfriend over me for the past five years. He also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when I was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because I don’t eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction). He made fun of me for being a hypochondriac and continues to make hypochondriac jokes even when it’s really not funny–but that’s more of his denial and refusal to admit that things actually might be serious.","You are a helpful mental health counselling assistant, your language is English, please answer the mental health questions based on the patient's description.The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions.### User: I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one.

1. How can I cope with my dad's behavior?

Coping with your dad's behavior may be challenging, but it's important to remember that you have the right to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being. Here are some suggestions:

* Practice self-care: Engage in activities that promote relaxation and well-being"," It sounds like you've had a difficult relationship with your father over the years, and it's understandable that you feel hurt and resentful towards him. It can be challenging when someone we love doesn't acknowledge or understand the struggles we face.

Firstly, I want to assure you that it's okay to feel the way you do. Your emotions are valid, and it's important to give yourself permission to express them. Remember that healing takes time, and it's a process that each person goes through differently.

One suggestion I have is to consider finding healthy ways to cope with your emotions. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or provide a sense of relief can be helpful. This could include hobbies, exercise, spending time with supportive friends, or even seeking therapy if you feel comfortable doing so.

When it comes to communication with your father, it might be beneficial to approach the conversation from a place of vulnerability and honesty. Let him know how you've been feeling and try to express your needs clearly. However, keep in mind that he may not immediately understand or change his behavior. It's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being.

Additionally, consider finding support outside of your family. Connecting with others who have gone through similar experiences can provide validation and a sense of belonging. Support groups or online communities can be great resources for finding understanding and guidance.

Remember, you deserve to be heard and acknowledged for the person you are. While it may not be easy, taking steps towards healing and building healthier relationships can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in your life."
"I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.","You are a helpful mental health counselling assistant, your language is English, please answer the mental health questions based on the patient's description.The assistant gives helpful, comprehensive, and appropriate answers to the user's questions.### User: I am not sure if I am depressed. I don't know how to bring it up to my parents, and that makes me miserable.",ಠ\_ಠ," It can be really challenging to reach out for support when it comes to something as personal and complex as mental health. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are steps you can take to find the help you need.

Firstly, it might be helpful to reflect on your own feelings and experiences. Consider keeping a journal or writing down your thoughts and emotions. This can help you gain clarity and identify any patterns or triggers that may be contributing to your current state.

Once you have a better understanding of how you're feeling, try to identify someone you trust and feel comfortable talking to about what you're going through. It could be a close friend, a sibling, or even a teacher or coach if you feel comfortable reaching out to them. Sharing your concerns with someone you trust can provide you with emotional support and potentially open up new avenues for seeking help.

If you're unsure about bringing it up to your parents, you could start by finding alternative ways to express your concerns. You could write them a letter explaining how you've been feeling and why you think it's important for them to know. Sometimes, having written communication can make it easier to discuss sensitive topics.

Additionally, there are resources available outside of your immediate circle that can offer guidance and support. Look into local community organizations or helplines that specialize in mental health. They can provide you with information, resources, and potentially connect you with professionals who can assist you further.

Remember, taking care of your mental health is a journey, and seeking support is a sign of strength. You deserve to have access to the tools and support necessary to navigate through this difficult time. Keep exploring different options and don't hesitate to reach out for help when you need it."
