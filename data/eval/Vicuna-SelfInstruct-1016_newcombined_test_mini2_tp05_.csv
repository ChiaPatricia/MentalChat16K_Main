"I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy).","1. What is the best way to handle your need for knowing someone's whereabouts?
2. How does this need for information affect your ability to trust people?
3. Have you ever experienced any negative consequences due to your need for information about someone's whereabouts?
4. Is there a way to balance your need for information with the privacy of others?
5. How can you learn to trust people without knowing their whereabouts?
6. Is there a way to overcome your fear of not knowing someone's whereabouts?
7. How does this need for information compare to your need for information about other aspects of someone's life?
8. How does this need for information affect your ability to form new relationships?
9. Is there a way to address this need for information in a healthy way?
10. How can you learn to trust people without knowing their whereabouts?"," It's understandable that knowing someone's whereabouts can help you feel more at ease and allow you to start building trust. However, it's important to remember that trust is a gradual process that develops over time, regardless of whether or not you know someone's living location.

Instead of solely focusing on where someone lives, try to pay attention to their actions, words, and behaviors. Take the time to get to know them better by engaging in open and honest conversations. Ask questions about their interests, hobbies, and values. This can help you gain insight into their character and make a more informed decision about whether or not you feel comfortable trusting them.

Additionally, it might be helpful to reflect on any past experiences that have influenced your need for trust or control. Sometimes, our fears and anxieties stem from previous negative encounters. By exploring these feelings further, you may gain a better understanding of why you feel the need to know someone's living location in order to trust them.

Remember, trust is built gradually through consistent positive interactions and experiences. It's okay to take your time and allow the relationship to develop naturally. By focusing on getting to know someone as an individual rather than solely relying on external factors like location, you can create a stronger foundation for trust and connection."
"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I am feeling very clueless at times. I don’t know what I want out of life in general. I’m basically sitting here, accepting failure and it’s not worrying me as much as it should. I’ve been feeling drastically lazy. Pretty much I just sit and watch TV and just spend my time very unproductively and don’t want to be this way. I’m not depressed; it’s just my mind and body won’t allow me to do things that I should be doing. If you suggest anything, please let me know. Thank you.","你好！It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of confusion and a lack of direction in life, as well as a sense of lethargy and unproductivity. These are common feelings that many people experience at some point in their lives.

One thing you could try is to take some time to reflect on what you truly want out of life. This could involve making a list of your values, interests, and passions, and then exploring different options for how you can pursue them. You could also try talking to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings, or seeking out the help of a mental health professional.

In the meantime, it might be helpful to try to break up your day into smaller, more manageable tasks, and to set achievable goals for yourself. This can help to give you a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue. Additionally, try to engage in activities that bring you joy and help you to feel more energized, such as exercise, spending time in nature, or engaging in a hobby you enjoy.

Remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and to need help sometimes. Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to take things one step at a time."," It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of uncertainty and confusion about yourself and your life at the moment. It's completely normal to feel this way from time to time, but it can be really challenging when it starts affecting your motivation and productivity.

One suggestion I have is to start exploring your interests and passions. Engaging in activities that you enjoy can help bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment into your life. Consider trying out new hobbies or revisiting old ones that you used to enjoy. This could be anything from painting, writing, playing an instrument, or even taking up a sport or fitness routine.

Another helpful strategy is setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Start by identifying one area of your life where you feel stuck or unmotivated, and break it down into smaller steps. For example, if you want to be more productive, you could begin by creating a daily schedule or setting aside specific times for work or study. Celebrate each small accomplishment along the way, as this can boost your confidence and motivation.

Additionally, taking care of your physical health can have a positive impact on your mental well-being. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in regular exercise. Physical activity releases endorphins, which can improve your mood and overall sense of well-being.

Lastly, consider reaching out to supportive friends or family members who can provide encouragement and accountability. Sometimes talking to someone we trust about our struggles can help us gain new perspectives and insights.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it may take time to figure out what works best for you. Be patient with yourself and keep exploring different strategies until you find what brings you joy and fulfillment."
"Hi, within the past year I have been hospitalized three times and I have been in two treatment centers. I have been diagnosed with everything from Borderline to Bipolar with Psychosis, but all of my treating physicians say that those diagnosis’ are incorrect. I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can’t tell the difference between different emotions, I don’t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don’t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren’t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can’t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it’s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have people pulling me every which a way, I am tired of all of this. I feel like no one understands me. I know you don’t know me but can you tell me possibly what is going on. I would appreciate anything. Thank you!",你好，我是一名心理健康輔導員，我很關心你的描述。你在過去一年中被送進了三次醫院，並且在兩個治療中心接受了治療。你被診斷出有從 Borderline 到 Bipolar 精神疾病，但你所有的治療醫生都認為這些診斷是錯誤的。你經常感到自殺的念頭，並且經常自傷，你也很可能會參與危險的行為，你缺乏眼神交流，無法區分不同情緒，沒有感覺，你有社交焦慮，不喜歡被觸碰，當事情不按照你的期望進行或物品不在正確的位置時會發生幻覺，當特定的聲音發生時會感到狂喜，當有聲音時會很難集中注意力，你會產生強烈的執着，當你讀書時會發聲，當你感到壓力或激動時容易發作，你感到唯一的情感是憤怒、沮喪和空虛，你可能會有一些物品堆積現象，你也有困難與人交流，你的心理治�����������," It sounds like you've been through a lot and are experiencing a lot of challenging symptoms. It's important to remember that everyone's experience with mental health is unique, so what works for one person may not work for another. However, there are some general suggestions that might be helpful for you.

Firstly, it could be beneficial to seek out a therapist who specializes in trauma or dissociative disorders. They may have more experience in understanding and addressing the specific issues you're facing. Additionally, finding a therapist who uses a person-centered approach, where they prioritize your needs and goals, might be helpful.

In terms of coping strategies, grounding techniques can be useful when you feel disconnected from reality. One technique involves using your senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. For example, you can focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, the texture of an object in your hand, or the sounds around you. Another technique is deep breathing exercises, where you take slow, deep breaths to help calm your nervous system.

Engaging in activities that bring you joy and provide a sense of accomplishment can also be beneficial. This could include hobbies, creative outlets, or volunteering for causes that resonate with you. Surrounding yourself with supportive and understanding individuals who can offer emotional support may also be helpful.

Lastly, it's important to prioritize self-care. This means taking care of your physical health by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in regular exercise. Taking breaks when needed and practicing self-compassion are also essential.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and finding the right path for you may take time. It's important to be patient with yourself and seek support from professionals who can guide you through this process."
"My 19 year old brother may be clinically depressed. He does not want to take any direction in his life. He does not want to do the typical things that a teenager would normally do. Meaning, he does not want to get a job. He does not want to finish college (he wants to quit). He does not want to get a driver’s license. In fact, he doesn’t seem to think that these types of things even matter.","1. Is it normal for a 19-year-old to not want to take any direction in their life?

4. How can I encourage my brother to seek professional help?

Start by expressing your concern and letting him know that you care about his well-being. Use ""I"" statements to describe your feelings and experiences, rather than ""you"" statements that might make him feel attacked. For example, say, ""I've noticed that you've been struggling lately, and I'm worried about you. I think it would be helpful for you to talk to someone about what you're going through.""

It's important to remember that everyone's experience with depression is unique, but there are some general suggestions that may be helpful for him.

Firstly, it could be beneficial to encourage open communication with your brother. Let him know that you're there to listen and understand what he's going through. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a big difference.

Additionally, consider suggesting activities or hobbies that he might find enjoyable or fulfilling.

It could be something as simple as taking a walk in nature, reading a book, or trying out a new hobby like painting or playing an instrument.

While he may not see the importance of certain milestones like getting a job or finishing college right now, it might be helpful to explain to him how these experiences can shape his future and provide him with valuable skills and opportunities. However, ultimately, the decision should be his to make at his own pace.

Regarding his lack of interest in getting a driver's license, it's essential to prioritize his safety. You could offer to accompany him during the learning process or suggest researching online resources that can guide him through the steps involved.

Remember, this is a challenging time for your brother, and it's crucial to approach him with empathy and understanding. If his feelings persist or worsen, seeking professional help from a mental health expert could be beneficial. They can provide specialized guidance and support tailored to his specific needs.

Take care of yourself too, as supporting a loved one through difficult times can be emotionally draining. Make sure to prioritize self-care and seek support from friends or other trusted individuals who can provide you with a listening ear."
"I’ve been dating him for 5 months now and I truly love him. He was brought up in a middle class environment but struggled when growing up because of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He has a job as an apprentice engineer and he has said he will often have angry outbursts at work if he gets something wrong and will hurt himself by punching steel or whatever is nearby. He has extreme beliefs like he will own a particular city one day and change things to suit his “ideal”. He has extreme beliefs that all murders and rapists should be killed (he lives in UK). He comes across quite shy when talking to people (I’m not just saying this cause he’s my boyfriend but he’s really attractive conventionally so you’d think he’d be more confident); he will willingly talk to people but not make much eye contact. He gets very paranoid that I will cheat on him and says if I ever do I’ll never see him again and he says I’m the only person he loves and he wants to marry me in the future even although we’ve only been dating 5 months. He can be quite controlling and doesn’t like me smoking (he caught me smoking at a party and had a random shouting outburst at his friend when he tried to intervene). Last night when we were at his mum’s house he told her everything about him feeling angry at the slightest thing and he started crying cause I’m the only one he’s ever told about these feelings. He says I am the only thing that makes him happy, but he thinks I’m too naive and always wants to be there to protect me always because he always thinks the worst of people he doesn’t know. I’m really concerned and his mum and I suggested he see a counselor even although he really doesn’t want to. His mum thinks he has depression?? What do you think it could be?","1. Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine a specific diagnosis for your boyfriend. However, his symptoms of extreme beliefs, anger outbursts, and controlling behavior suggest that he may have a personality disorder, such as narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. Additionally, his ADHD and potential depression could also be contributing factors.
2. It is important for your boyfriend to seek professional help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can help him better understand and manage his symptoms, and determine an appropriate treatment plan.
3. It is important to approach the conversation about his behavior with sensitivity and understanding. It may be helpful to explain how his actions and beliefs are affecting you and how they are not in line with healthy relationships. Encourage him to seek professional help and offer to support him in this process.
4. It is important to remember that mental health conditions are not a reflection of a person's character or worth. It is also important to respect his boundaries and decisions about seeking help, but also to be supportive and understanding of his struggles.
5. It is important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being as well. Consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to help you cope with the situation and to maintain a healthy relationship."," It's great that you're seeking guidance on your concerns about your boyfriend. Based on the information you've provided, it's important to remember that I am not a mental health professional, but I can offer some suggestions and guidance.

From what you've shared, it seems like your boyfriend has been through a challenging upbringing due to his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which may have affected his self-esteem and confidence. It's also possible that his extreme beliefs and desire for control stem from his struggles with impulse control and managing anger.

Considering his outbursts at work and paranoid thoughts, it could be helpful for him to explore therapy options. Therapy can provide a safe space for him to express his emotions, work through any underlying issues, and develop healthier coping mechanisms. His mother's suggestion of counseling might be a good step, even though he doesn't want to go at the moment.

Regarding his mood swings and irritability, it's essential to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. Try to create an open line of communication where he feels comfortable sharing his feelings without judgment. Encourage him to find healthy outlets for his emotions, such as journaling or engaging in activities that bring him joy.

In terms of your concerns about his controlling behavior, it's important to establish boundaries and have open conversations about them. Let him know that while you appreciate his care and concern, it's important to respect your autonomy and individuality. Focus on building trust and finding a balance between being supportive and maintaining your own independence.

Remember, every individual is unique, and it's essential to approach each situation with empathy and understanding. If you feel that your well-being or safety are at risk, it may be necessary to seek additional support from a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance and assistance."

3"," It sounds like you have had a significant and meaningful relationship with your boyfriend despite the distance and challenges. It's understandable that you were cautious about visiting him due to safety concerns, especially given the circumstances of him being in the army and being sent to Afghanistan.

Building a connection through web cam dates, letters, emails, and cards is a creative way to maintain the relationship while he was away. It's important to remember that long-distance relationships can be difficult, but with dedication and open communication, they can also be very fulfilling.

One suggestion I have is to continue prioritizing open and honest communication with your boyfriend. Find ways to express your feelings and concerns about the situation, such as discussing any fears or anxieties you may have about his deployment or the challenges of being in the army. By sharing these emotions, you can strengthen your bond and create a supportive environment for each other.

Additionally, finding activities or hobbies that you both enjoy and can do together, even if physically apart, can help keep the connection alive. This could include watching movies or TV shows simultaneously, playing online games, or finding virtual workout classes or cooking classes that you can participate in together.

Lastly, it might be helpful to set realistic expectations for your relationship. Understand that due to his military duties, there may be periods where he is unable to engage in regular communication or spend time together. Accepting this reality and focusing on the moments you do have together can help alleviate any unnecessary stress or disappointment.

Remember, every relationship is unique, and it's important to adapt and find what works best for you and your boyfriend. Trust, understanding, and patience will be key in navigating this long-distance journey."

"I want to go back to my ex-husband from whom I’ve been divorced for over three years because of his violence. Before the divorce he ended up in jail for almost a year for domestic abuse. Since his release he says he’s changed. He’s gone to a local community mental health facility, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and adult ADHD. He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances. I see him on a regular basis and realize we still love each other, although it’s hard to believe that he loved me when he was abusive, which I now attribute to mental illness. The problem is threefold:","1. He still has intense mood swings and outbursts, which can be scary and unpredictable.
2. He has trouble managing his finances and often spends money impulsively, which can cause stress and conflict.
3. He has difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which can make it hard for him to provide for himself and his needs.

It's important to approach this situation with caution and consideration for your own well-being, as well as his. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and how his behavior is affecting you. It's also important to consider seeking support from a mental health professional or a support group to help you navigate this complex situation.","1. Understanding the dynamics of abusive behavior and mental illness is crucial in this situation. Abuse can be a result of various factors, including underlying mental health conditions. It's important to recognize that mental illness does not excuse or justify abusive behavior, but it can provide insight into the challenges your ex-husband may be facing.

2. Rebuilding trust after experiencing abuse takes time and patience. It's understandable that you may find it difficult to believe that he has truly changed, especially given his past actions. Consider starting with small steps towards rebuilding trust, such as gradually opening up to him about your feelings and concerns. Communication will play a vital role in rebuilding trust and understanding each other's perspectives.

3. Consider seeking support from friends, family, or a support group who can offer guidance and emotional support during this process. Having a strong support system can help you navigate the complexities of rebuilding a relationship after abuse.

4. Prioritize your own well-being throughout this journey. Engage in self-care activities that promote your mental health and overall happiness. This could include practicing relaxation techniques, engaging in hobbies, or seeking therapy if you feel it would benefit you.

"I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one. My parents divorced when I was nine and he immediately found a new girlfriend. They’ve been together ever since. I didn’t mind and actually liked the new family (she has a daughter my age), but when they moved in together I was never included as a part of the family and was treated as a “second-class citizen” by my stepmother. My father did nothing about this and usually took her side (albeit reluctantly) in order to avoid conflict because she threw fits if she didn’t get her way. I wasn’t allowed to use the nicest things in the house and was never allowed to be “better” than my stepsister–if the two of us came downstairs in similar outfits, I would be the one who had to go change. When I got a perfect score on the SATs, I wasn’t allowed to mention it because she didn’t do as well. These things seem trivial, and they are, but the gradual accumulation of this kind of thing over the years led me to resent him. I used to have pretty bad problems with depression–I lost 20 lbs in a month, my mood swung back and forth from hysterical to empty, I experienced dissociative episodes, self-medicated with drugs and I spent all my free time in bed, only coming out for meals. My dad didn’t ever acknowledge this and I feel like he was willfully ignorant about a lot of other things going on in my life. He never asked me about drinking, drugs, boyfriends, friends, and any difficulties I might be having and he never praised anything I did. I feel like I’m making him out to be a bad person, which he isn’t, but he just doesn’t want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he’d rather ignore it. He also (until I was in college) treated me like a child–I wasn’t allowed to hear bad words and he’d be obviously uncomfortable if I interacted in an equal way with adults in front of him. When he and his girlfriend temporarily broke up he became incredibly affectionate, which really upset me since he had consistently chosen his girlfriend over me for the past five years. He also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when I was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because I don’t eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction). He made fun of me for being a hypochondriac and continues to make hypochondriac jokes even when it’s really not funny–but that’s more of his denial and refusal to admit that things actually might be serious.","1.

Firstly, it's important to remember that everyone has their own way of dealing with emotions and conflicts. While your father may not be aware of how his actions impact you, it doesn't mean he doesn't care or isn't trying his best. However, it's also important to recognize that his approach may not be the most effective for you.

To start rebuilding your relationship with your father, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him about how his actions have affected you. Express your feelings and concerns calmly and clearly, using ""I"" statements to avoid sounding accusatory. For example, instead of saying ""You never listen to me,"" you could say ""I feel unheard and unsupported when you don't acknowledge my struggles.""

During this conversation, try to actively listen to his perspective as well. Understanding each other's viewpoints can help create a more balanced and empathetic dialogue. Remember, rebuilding a relationship takes time and effort from both sides.

In addition to having this conversation, consider finding healthy outlets for your emotions and stress. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment can help improve your overall well-being. This could include hobbies, exercise, spending time with supportive friends or family members, or even seeking therapy or counseling if you feel it would benefit you.

Lastly, remember that healing and forgiveness are complex processes. It's okay to take your time and give yourself permission to feel whatever emotions come up along the way. Be patient with yourself and trust that with time and effort, positive change is possible.

I hope these suggestions can provide some guidance as you navigate your relationship with your father. Remember, you deserve to be heard and supported, and by taking small steps towards open communication and self-care, you can work towards building a healthier connection with him."
