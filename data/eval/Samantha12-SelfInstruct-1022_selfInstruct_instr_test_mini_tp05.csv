I am an 18 yr old girl and I have recently been having trouble with self harm. I used to cut in the past but got help and medication (Zoloft).

It's commendable that you sought help in the past and received treatment for self-harm. The fact that you're reaching out for support again shows your commitment to addressing your emotional well-being. Hitting and slamming your head against walls can be a sign of distress and may be indicative of underlying emotional or mental health issues.

It's understandable that self-assessment quizzes might not provide a definitive diagnosis, as they often rely on subjective responses and may not capture the full complexity of your experiences. However, it's important to recognize that bipolar disorder is a serious mental health condition that requires professional evaluation and diagnosis.

Your boyfriend's concern and support are a testament to the importance of having a strong support network. It's essential to maintain open communication with him about your feelings and experiences, so he can better understand your needs and provide the appropriate support.

In addition to maintaining your support network, it may be helpful to explore other coping strategies and techniques to manage your emotions and impulses. Some options include:

1. Engaging in therapy to address the underlying causes of your self-harming behaviors and develop healthier coping mechanisms.
2. Practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques to help you manage intense emotions in the moment.
3. Seeking support from a peer support group, where you can connect with others who have experienced similar challenges.
4. Ensuring you maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a nutritious diet.

Please remember that healing is a process, and it's essential to be patient with yourself as you work towards recovery. I'm here to support you in any way I can, and I encourage you to continue seeking professional help and the support of your loved ones.

"," It's great that you reached out for help in the past and started taking medication. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of distress and frustration, which can be really challenging to deal with on your own. Since the quizzes are not providing a definitive answer, it might be helpful to consider seeking professional guidance from a mental health expert or therapist who can provide personalized support.

In the meantime, there are some coping strategies you can try to manage your emotions and impulses. One approach is to engage in activities that distract and calm you down during moments of irritability or intense feelings. This could include things like deep breathing exercises, listening to music, drawing, writing, or engaging in any hobby that brings you joy and relaxation.

Additionally, having a support system in place can make a big difference. Consider talking to your boyfriend about what he can do to support you during these difficult times. He may not fully understand what you're going through, but expressing your needs and concerns can help him provide better emotional support.

Remember to be patient with yourself throughout this process. Recovery takes time, and setbacks are normal. Celebrate small victories along the way and acknowledge the progress you've made, even if it feels insignificant at times.

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to helplines or crisis hotlines available in your area. They have trained professionals who can offer guidance and assistance when you feel overwhelmed or unsure of where to turn.

It's common for people to experience anxiety about everyday stressors, as these concerns can have a significant impact on our lives. Anxiety can manifest in various ways, and it's important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing it.

One effective way to cope with anxiety is by practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques. These techniques can help you stay present in the moment and reduce the intensity of anxious thoughts. Additionally, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be helpful in identifying and changing negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.

It's also essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep. These factors can have a significant impact on your mental well-being and ability to cope with stress.

"," It's completely normal to feel anxious about everyday stressors. Many people experience similar concerns regarding finances, work, relationships, children, and maintaining a household. It can be overwhelming to juggle all these responsibilities and worries at once.

One suggestion I have is to prioritize and break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help alleviate some of the pressure and make it easier to tackle one issue at a time. For example, if you're feeling stressed about finances, you could start by creating a budget or seeking advice from a financial planner. Taking small actions like this can provide a sense of control and progress.

Additionally, finding healthy coping mechanisms can greatly benefit your mental well-being. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, can help reduce stress levels. Prioritizing self-care is crucial in managing anxiety.

Building a support system is also important. Reach out to friends, family members, or even online communities who may be going through similar experiences. Sharing your feelings and receiving empathy can provide comfort and reassurance.

Consider exploring techniques like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or meditation. These practices can help calm your mind and promote a greater sense of peace and clarity. There are numerous resources available online, including apps and guided meditation videos, that can assist you in learning and implementing these techniques.

Lastly, don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed. Mental health professionals are trained to provide guidance and support tailored to your specific situation. They can offer additional strategies and tools to manage anxiety effectively.

Remember, it's okay to feel anxious about everyday stressors. By prioritizing tasks, engaging in self-care activities, building a support system, exploring relaxation techniques, and considering professional help when necessary, you can navigate these challenges with greater ease. wish you the best on your journey towards managing anxiety and finding peace. thank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns about everyday stressors.

"When already in the ‘possible divorce’ zone does a husband forgetting your anniversary mean he might not love you?

It's understandable that the events you've described have taken a toll on your relationship and trust in your husband. The fact that he has been unfaithful and has lied about it for so long is a significant issue.

While forgetting an anniversary might not be intentional, it could be a sign of his preoccupation with other matters or a reflection of the state of your relationship. It's essential to remember that everyone has different ways of expressing love and affection, and it's possible that your husband's actions may not align with your expectations.

In the context of your relationship's challenges, it's crucial to have an open and honest conversation with your husband about your feelings, needs, and concerns. This conversation should include discussing your expectations for love and affection, as well as the importance of trust and honesty in your relationship.

It's also important to consider whether you both are willing to work on rebuilding trust and addressing the issues that have arisen in your relationship. Couples therapy or seeking professional guidance can be helpful in navigating these challenges.

Remember that healing and rebuilding trust take time, and it's essential to be patient with yourself and your partner during this process.

"," It sounds like you've been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that you're feeling confused and fearful. It can be really challenging to navigate these situations, especially when trust has been broken multiple times.

While I'm not an expert, I can offer some guidance based on my own experiences and observations. Firstly, communication is key. Open and honest conversations with your husband about your feelings and concerns are essential for rebuilding trust and understanding. Try to create a safe space where both of you can express yourselves without judgment or defensiveness.

Additionally, it might be helpful to explore couples therapy as a way to work through the issues together. A trained professional can provide guidance and support, helping both of you navigate the complex emotions and challenges that arise from infidelity. They can also assist in addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to the affair in the first place.

Rebuilding trust takes time and effort from both partners. It's important to set realistic expectations and understand that healing won't happen overnight. Be patient with yourself and your husband, and remember that progress may come in small steps. Celebrate the progress you make along the way, no matter how small it may seem.

Lastly, consider seeking support for yourself. Connecting with friends, family, or even online communities of individuals who have experienced similar situations can provide you with emotional support and validation. Taking care of your own well-being is crucial during this process.

Remember, every relationship is unique, and what works for one couple may not work for another. Trust your instincts and do what feels right for you. wish you strength and courage as you navigate this difficult journey.............................................................................."

It's not uncommon for people to feel shy or uncomfortable with eye contact, especially when it comes to close friends or family members. However, if you find that this avoidance is causing you distress or impacting your relationships, it might be worth exploring the underlying causes.

One possibility is that you may be experiencing social anxiety, which can manifest in various ways, including avoidance of eye contact. This anxiety can stem from a fear of judgment, rejection, or the need to constantly perform well in social situations.

Another possibility is that you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. Feeling down and lacking motivation to communicate with others are common signs of depression.

To better understand the root cause of your avoidance of eye contact and other behaviors, it might be helpful to consult with a mental health professional. They can help you explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences to develop a deeper understanding of your mental health and provide guidance on coping strategies or treatments that may be beneficial for you.

You might find it helpful to practice gradually increasing your eye contact with people you feel comfortable with, such as close friends or family members. Start by trying to maintain eye contact for a few seconds during conversations and gradually work your way up from there.

2. Conversation difficulties: When it comes to holding normal conversations, it can be helpful to actively listen to what others are saying and respond thoughtfully. Practice summarizing or repeating back what someone has said to show that you're engaged in the conversation. Additionally, consider whether any underlying thoughts or feelings might be affecting your ability to concentrate or give enough attention to others. Reflecting on this can provide insights into potential underlying causes.

3. Feeling down in the morning: Waking up feeling down can be challenging, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique experiences and emotions. However, if this persists over time, it may be beneficial to explore potential factors contributing to your mood. Consider any recent changes in your life, such as stressful events or shifts in routine, which could be influencing your emotional state. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or practicing self-care rituals in the morning, such as exercise or mindfulness, may also help improve your mood.

"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly.

Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn.

It's understandable that you feel concerned about the cleanliness of your kitchen and the potential health risks associated with improper hygiene practices. It's important to approach the situation with patience and understanding, as it may be that your father has developed certain habits or routines that he finds difficult to change.

Here are a few suggestions to address the issue:

1. Open communication: Have an open and honest conversation with your father, expressing your concerns about hygiene and the importance of maintaining a clean kitchen. Make sure to approach the topic in a non-confrontational manner, and express your love and appreciation for him.

2. Collaborative approach: Offer to help your father by creating a checklist or routine for kitchen cleaning. This can help ensure that all tasks are completed and provide a visual reminder of the necessary steps.

3. Educate and inform: Share information about food safety and proper hygiene practices with your father. This may help him understand the potential risks and the importance of following specific guidelines.

4. Seek professional help: If the issue persists, it might be helpful to consult with a mental health professional who can help identify any underlying causes for your father's behavior and provide guidance on how to address the issue.

Remember, change can be difficult, and it's essential to be patient and understanding as you work together to improve the situation. hope this helps!

"," It sounds like you and your dad have a good relationship overall, but there have been some issues with his hygiene habits in the kitchen. It's understandable that you're concerned about germs and want to ensure that you and your sister eat healthy meals in a clean environment.

When trying to get your dad to follow basic hygiene practices in the kitchen, it might be helpful to approach the situation with patience and understanding. Instead of constantly pestering him, you could try having a calm conversation about your concerns. Explain why it's important to wash hands before cooking and clean the kitchen properly after use. Provide him with simple steps or guidelines on how to do these tasks effectively.

Additionally, consider finding alternative ways to communicate if he seems to tune out when you talk directly to him. Some people respond better to visual aids or written instructions, so you could create a checklist or poster reminding him of the necessary steps.

It's also worth considering if there might be any underlying reasons for his resistance. Sometimes, individuals may struggle with change or feel anxious about certain tasks. You could ask him if there's anything specific that makes these chores difficult for him, so you can find potential solutions together.

Involving your mum in the conversation or asking her to demonstrate the tasks for your dad might also be beneficial. She can provide additional support and guidance, as she is more familiar with his needs and preferences.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with your dad as he adjusts to taking on more responsibility in the household. Celebrate small victories along the way and offer praise when he does follow the hygiene practices you've discussed.

By approaching the situation with empathy, understanding, and consistent communication, you may be able to help your dad feel more comfortable with these tasks and create a healthier environment for your family. best wishes as you navigate this situation. jessica.

Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.

It's common to feel anxious in situations like these, and it's important to remember that these feelings are temporary. One effective way to manage anxiety in these situations is through mindfulness and deep-breathing exercises. By focusing on your breath and staying present in the moment, you can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. Additionally, practicing visualization techniques, such as imagining a peaceful, calming environment, can also be helpful in managing anxiety.

"," It can be really challenging to experience such intense physical and emotional symptoms when you're in public or around large groups of people. It sounds like these situations trigger a strong fear response in you, which leads to feeling light-headed, sweaty, and struggling with your breathing.

One suggestion I have is to try some deep breathing exercises when you start to feel overwhelmed. Taking slow, deep breaths can help regulate your body's stress response and bring a sense of calmness. You can try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a moment, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times until you begin to feel more grounded.

Another technique that might be helpful is gradually exposing yourself to similar situations in smaller steps. For example, you could start by attending smaller social gatherings or speaking in front of just a few people at a time. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually increase the size of the crowds or the complexity of public speaking engagements. This gradual exposure can help build your confidence and reduce the fear associated with these situations.

Additionally, it may be beneficial to explore any underlying thoughts or beliefs that contribute to your anxiety. Sometimes our minds create negative scenarios or assumptions about what might happen in these situations, which can amplify our fears. Consider keeping a journal to jot down your thoughts and feelings before, during, and after these experiences. This can help identify patterns or triggers that you can work on addressing with a professional if needed.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, so it's important to find strategies that work best for you. If these suggestions don't provide enough relief, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can offer personalized guidance and support. They can provide additional tools and techniques tailored to your specific needs.

Take care of yourself and be patient with the process. Overcoming fears and anxieties takes time and effort, but with persistence and support, you can make progress towards feeling more comfortable in public and around large crowds. wish you the best on your journey towards managing your anxiety. liz

It's natural to feel disappointed when your efforts aren't perceived as you intended. However, it's essential to remember that people may have different expectations, and it's impossible to please everyone all the time. Instead of assuming the worst, try having an open conversation with the people involved. Explain your intentions and ask for their feedback. This can help clarify any misunderstandings and provide an opportunity for growth and understanding.

Another approach is to focus on your own growth and development. Aim to learn from each experience and use it as an opportunity to improve your skills and understanding. This can help you build resilience and maintain a positive mindset, even when things don't go as planned.

If you find that these feelings persist or impact your daily life, it may be helpful to consult a mental health professional who can provide additional support and guidance.

"," It can be really frustrating and disheartening when you feel like you're constantly falling short of others' expectations. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique way of doing things, and not everyone will appreciate your efforts in the same way. Instead of focusing on what others may think, try shifting your perspective towards your own growth and development.

One suggestion is to take some time to reflect on your own values and priorities. What truly matters to you in the work you do? By aligning your efforts with your own goals and principles, you'll not only feel more fulfilled but also build a stronger sense of self-confidence.

Additionally, consider seeking feedback from those who appreciate your work. Ask them specifically what they value about your contributions and how you can continue to improve. This feedback can provide valuable insights and help you identify areas where you excel and areas that could use improvement.

Remember, it's normal to encounter people who may not connect with your work or personality. However, by focusing on your own growth and seeking feedback from those who appreciate your efforts, you can gradually build a portfolio of successes and increase your confidence in your abilities.

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to supportive friends or family members who can offer encouragement and perspective during challenging times. Sometimes having an objective viewpoint can make a significant difference in how we perceive ourselves and our accomplishments.

Keep in mind that building a career or any aspect of life is a journey filled with ups and downs. By staying true to yourself, seeking constructive feedback, and surrounding yourself with positive influences, you can navigate these challenges and ultimately find fulfillment in your work. wish you the best of luck on this journey!, I appreciate your efforts and want to provide some guidance on how you can continue to improve your communication skills.

One suggestion is to practice active listening. When engaging in conversations, try to genuinely listen to what the other person is saying without interrupting or formulating responses in your mind. Reflect back their thoughts and feelings to show that you understand and care about their perspective.

Additionally, it might be helpful to work on your non-verbal communication skills. Pay attention to your body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions, as they can convey emotions even when words fail to do so. Being aware of these subtle cues can enhance your ability to connect with others and convey your message"

"I have seen my therapist for several years and she has been extremely helpful. Despite the number of years we have worked together, I still find opening up with her and sharing certain feelings or thoughts extremely difficult. Part of this is due to the fact that I have a hard time identifying my feelings and describing them. My therapist on the other hand is so insightful and can nail my feelings down with her questioning. I am very thankful she is able to do this (and also amazed at her ability to find the right word to help describe how I feel).","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

It's not uncommon for people to struggle with identifying and expressing their feelings, especially in the context of a therapeutic relationship. Your therapist's ability to help you uncover and articulate your emotions is a testament to her skill and empathy.

There are several reasons why it might be challenging for you to open up and share your feelings. One possibility is that you may have internalized certain beliefs or fears that make it difficult to express vulnerability. For example, you might worry that sharing certain feelings could be perceived as a sign of weakness or that it could jeopardize your relationship with your therapist.

Another possibility is that you may have developed certain coping mechanisms or patterns of thinking that make it difficult to recognize and process your emotions. This could include things like intellectualizing or rationalizing your feelings, or simply not paying attention to them.

Working through these challenges is an important part of the therapeutic process, and your therapist's ability to help you navigate these complexities is a valuable skill.

As you continue your journey, consider exploring the following strategies to help you open up more easily:

1. Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel vulnerable and that expressing your emotions is a sign of strength, not weakness.

2. Be patient with yourself: Understand that it takes time to build trust and develop a deeper connection with your therapist. Give yourself the space and time needed to open up.

3. Reflect on your thoughts and feelings: Try to become more aware of your emotions and thoughts throughout the day. Keep a journal to help you process your experiences and emotions.

4. Use visualization techniques: Visualize a safe and supportive environment where you feel comfortable sharing your feelings. This can help create a mental space where you feel more at ease.

5. Engage in mindfulness practices: Mindfulness techniques can help you become more present and attuned to your emotions, making it easier to share them with your therapist.

Remember, your therapist is there to support you, and her ability to understand and empathize with your feelings is a testament to her skill and commitment to helping you. Keep working on building trust and openness, and know that it's completely normal to encounter challenges along the way.

"," It's wonderful that you've been working with your therapist for several years and finding her to be helpful. It can be challenging to open up and share certain feelings or thoughts, even after a long time in therapy. It sounds like you struggle with identifying your feelings and describing them, but it's great that your therapist is able to help you with this through her questioning.

One suggestion I have is to try journaling or keeping a diary outside of therapy sessions. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can sometimes make it easier to process them and gain clarity. You might find it helpful to reflect on what comes up for you between sessions and jot down any specific moments or experiences that you want to discuss with your therapist.

Additionally, practicing self-awareness exercises can assist in becoming more in tune with your emotions. Mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can create space for you to observe and acknowledge your feelings without judgment. There are also many resources available, such as books or online articles, that provide guidance on emotional intelligence and understanding one's feelings.

Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, so don't hesitate to communicate your concerns or difficulties with your therapist. She may be able to offer additional strategies or techniques tailored specifically to your needs. Keep in mind that progress takes time, and it's okay to have moments of struggle along the way.

Overall, I encourage you to be patient with yourself and continue working with your therapist. She seems to be a valuable resource who is supportive and insightful. Together, you can navigate the challenges of identifying and describing your feelings, leading to greater self-awareness and personal growth., I encourage you to be patient with yourself and continue working with your therapist.

"My fiance and I are in a long distance relationship. We were dating and engaged for 4 years before I broke up with him and relocated across county.

It was like this in the past. I’ve been a bit of a hermit the past year and, at his urging, he tells me to find friends and find things to do. I mention to him, a female co-worker and I were chatting about our love of cooking. She mentioned she throws a dinner party once in awhile and I said I’d love to go.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

It's not uncommon for long-distance relationships to face challenges when transitioning to a more traditional arrangement. The fact that you and your fiancé have been through a similar situation before gives you both some experience in navigating these changes.

It's important to recognize that revisiting past issues can be a normal part of the healing process. However, it's also crucial to actively work on addressing those issues and finding solutions that work for both of you.

In your case, it seems that one of the challenges you face is finding a balance between your partner's desire for you to socialize and your personal need for solitude. It's essential to communicate openly and empathetically about your feelings and needs.

Your partner may feel concerned about your well-being and want to encourage you to build a support network. At the same time, you may need time to adjust to your new environment and may not be ready to engage in social activities at the same pace as he would like.

It's important to find a compromise that respects both your needs and desires. This may involve gradually introducing social events into your routine or finding activities that you both enjoy.

As you navigate these challenges, remember to be patient with yourself and your partner. It's normal for adjustments to take time, and it's essential to give yourselves the space to grow together.

"," It sounds like you and your fiance have been through a lot together, and it's understandable that past issues are resurfacing in your relationship. It's great that you've been able to reconcile and work on those issues for the past year.

When it comes to how you choose to spend your free time, it's important to find a balance between activities that bring you joy and ones that your partner enjoys as well. It seems like cooking is something you both enjoy, so participating in your co-worker's dinner party could be a fun way to bond with her and explore a shared interest.

However, it's also important to communicate openly with your fiance about this plan. Let him know that you value his input and understand his concerns about you spending time with another man. Assure him that the intention behind going to the dinner party is to enjoy a shared hobby, not to pursue a romantic connection.

Building new friendships and engaging in activities outside of your relationship can actually strengthen your bond and provide opportunities for growth. Encourage your fiance to pursue his own interests and hobbies as well, so that both of you can have fulfilling lives both individually and together.

Remember, open communication and understanding are key in any relationship. By actively listening to each other's needs and concerns, you can work together to find a compromise that allows both of you to feel secure and supported. hope this guidance helps you navigate this situation and continue to build a healthy and fulfilling long-distance relationship. wish you the best of luck!."
