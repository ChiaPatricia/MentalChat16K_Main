It's commendable that you sought help in the past and received treatment for self-harm. I understand that it can be challenging to navigate your emotions, especially when they fluctuate significantly. Bipolar disorder is a possibility, but only a professional diagnosis can confirm that.

It's important to remember that quizzes and online assessments are not a substitute for a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional. They can provide a general idea, but they should not be relied upon solely for diagnosis.

Your boyfriend's concern and support are a testament to the importance of having a strong support system during difficult times. It's essential to communicate openly with him about your feelings and emotions, so he can better understand your experiences and provide the support you need.

In terms of coping strategies, it may be helpful to explore alternative methods to self-harm, such as journaling, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in creative outlets like painting or writing. Additionally, regular therapy sessions and maintaining your medication regimen can be crucial in managing your emotions and promoting overall well-being.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or need further support. I'm here to help.

"," It's important to acknowledge the strength and courage it takes to reach out for support, especially when dealing with self-harm. It sounds like you've already taken some positive steps by seeking help in the past and starting medication.

Given your concerns about bipolar disorder, it may be helpful to consider speaking with a mental health professional who can provide a more accurate diagnosis. They can guide you through a comprehensive evaluation, taking into account your unique circumstances and emotions. This would involve discussing your symptoms, medical history, and any other relevant factors.

In the meantime, there are coping strategies that you can try to manage your impulses to hurt yourself. One approach is distraction techniques, such as engaging in activities that capture your attention and redirect your focus away from self-harm. For example, listening to music, reading a book, or spending time with loved ones can help distract you from harmful behaviors.

Additionally, developing a safety plan with your boyfriend or someone else you trust can be beneficial. This plan should include steps to take during moments of distress, such as reaching out to supportive individuals, going to a safe place, or practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing or grounding exercises.

Building a strong support system is crucial during this time. Consider talking to friends, family members, or even online communities where you feel understood and accepted. Surrounding yourself with people who care about your well-being can make a significant difference.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to be patient with yourself as you navigate through this process. Keep seeking guidance and exploring different resources until you find what works best for you. health questions based on the patient's description.

### Input:
I have anxieties about everyday stressors, i.e. finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household.

","1:
It's normal to experience anxiety about everyday stressors, as they can be challenging to navigate. However, if these anxieties are causing significant distress or interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to seek professional support to develop coping strategies and techniques to manage your anxiety more effectively. Some common approaches to addressing anxiety include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness techniques, and stress management.

### Input:
I'm not sure if I should seek professional help.

"," It's completely normal to feel anxious about everyday stressors. Many people experience similar concerns regarding finances, work, relationships, children, and maintaining a household. It can be overwhelming to juggle all these responsibilities and worries at once.

One suggestion I have is to prioritize and break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This can help alleviate some of the pressure and make it easier to tackle one thing at a time. Create a to-do list or use a planner to keep track of what needs to be done and when. Celebrate small victories along the way, as this can boost your confidence and motivation.

Additionally, finding healthy coping mechanisms can be beneficial in managing anxiety. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, can help reduce stress levels. Taking breaks and practicing self-care is crucial for maintaining your mental well-being.

When it comes to finances, consider creating a budget to better manage your expenses and savings. This can provide a sense of control and stability in an area that often causes anxiety for many individuals. Seeking advice from a financial advisor or researching online resources can also offer guidance and support.

Regarding work-related stress, communicate openly with your supervisor or colleagues about any concerns or challenges you may be facing. They may be able to provide assistance or accommodations to help alleviate some of the pressure. Additionally, practicing effective time management techniques and setting realistic goals can contribute to a healthier work-life balance.

In terms of relationships, open and honest communication is key. Express your needs and concerns to your partner, family members, or friends, and encourage them to do the same. Sometimes, simply talking through your worries can provide relief and strengthen your connections. If needed, consider seeking couples therapy or relationship counseling to navigate any difficulties you may be experiencing.

Lastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help when needed. Building a support system of trusted friends, family members, or mentors can provide guidance and reassurance during challenging times. Sometimes, just knowing that you have someone to talk to can make a significant difference.

I hope these suggestions help you in managing your anxieties about everyday stressors. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself and celebrate the progress you make along the way. wish you the best in finding peace and balance"
"When already in the ‘possible divorce’ zone does a husband forgetting your anniversary mean he might not love you? Me and my husband have had a rocky relationship but lately it has escalated to the point of talking about separating or divorce. 7 months after the wedding I found out he was having an affair with an ex. When confronted he blamed me and treated me very harshly. We ended up staying together but he would never speak of his infedelity really which has caused 8 years of questions, fears, and continuous pain for me. About a month ago I reached a point where I no longer cared about his reaction, I just needed answers! He admitted to a few things, one of which was having an affair with the same woman a year before we got married when we were having problems. I had accused him of this for 9 years but he denied it vehemently and made me feel horrible for even thinking it.

It's understandable that the events in your relationship have been challenging and have caused you to question your husband's love. While forgetting an anniversary may not be a direct indication of a lack of love, it can be an indication of other issues at play, such as stress, preoccupation, or even a lack of priority in the relationship.

It's important to recognize that relationships are complex and can go through various stages, including periods of difficulty. The key is to work together to address the issues that arise and seek professional help if needed.

In your situation, it may be helpful to engage in open and honest communication with your husband. Share your feelings and concerns, and encourage him to do the same. This can help you both gain a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives and work towards finding solutions together.

It's also essential to remember that healing and rebuilding trust take time. Be patient with yourself and your partner as you navigate this process.

As a mental health counselling assistant, I'm here to support you in any way I can. If you'd like to discuss your situation further or explore strategies for improving your relationship, please don't hesitate to reach out.

"," It sounds like you've been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that you're feeling confused and fearful. It can be really challenging to navigate trust issues after an affair, especially when there have been years of denial and accusations.

One important thing to remember is that actions speak louder than words. While your husband may say he loves you, his actions during the anniversary, as well as his past behavior, can provide insights into his feelings. Consider whether his forgetting the anniversary is a reflection of his true priorities or if it's simply a result of the stress you're currently experiencing.

In terms of rebuilding trust, open and honest communication will be key. It might be helpful to have a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your husband about your feelings and concerns. Express how his actions have affected you and explain what you need from him moving forward. This could include being more accountable, showing remorse for his past actions, and actively working on rebuilding trust together.

Regarding your sex life, it's essential to approach this topic with understanding and empathy. The trauma of an affair can significantly impact one's desire and ability to engage in intimate connections. It may be helpful to seek support from a couples therapist who specializes in infidelity recovery. They can provide guidance on rebuilding intimacy and addressing any underlying issues that may be contributing to the difficulties in your sex life.

Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. Be patient with yourself and each other as you navigate this journey towards rebuilding trust and finding closure. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you work through these challenges. wish you strength and courage as you"

It's not uncommon for people to feel shy or uncomfortable with eye contact, especially when they're just getting to know someone or in new social situations. However, if you're consistently avoiding eye contact and it's impacting your ability to connect with others and engage in conversations, it could be a sign of an underlying issue.

Anxiety and depression are common mental health concerns that can contribute to avoidance behaviors like this. It's important to remember that you're not too old to seek help if you're experiencing emotional difficulties. I encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional who can help you explore the root cause of your avoidance and develop coping strategies to improve your social interactions and overall well-being.

It's also important to be patient with yourself during this process. Change takes time, and it's normal to experience setbacks along the way. Remember that you're not alone, and there are resources available to support you.

"," It sounds like you've been experiencing some difficulties with eye contact and conversations, as well as feeling down in the morning. It's understandable that you might be wondering if there's something more going on here. While I'm not a professional, I can offer some suggestions that may help you navigate these challenges.

1. Start by practicing eye contact: One way to improve your comfort with eye contact is to gradually expose yourself to it. Begin by looking into a mirror and holding eye contact with yourself for short periods of time. Then, try practicing eye contact with people you feel comfortable around, such as close friends or family members. Remember to take things at your own pace and be patient with yourself.

2. Explore potential underlying causes: Consider reflecting on any recent changes or events in your life that could have triggered these feelings. Sometimes, stress, anxiety, or other emotional factors can impact our ability to connect with others. Keeping a journal or talking to someone you trust about your thoughts and emotions may provide valuable insights.

3. Prioritize self-care: Taking care of your physical and mental well-being is crucial. Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Engaging in regular exercise, practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises, and maintaining a balanced lifestyle can also contribute to an overall sense of well-being.

4. Seek support from loved ones: Reach out to your support system and let them know what you've been experiencing. Sharing your feelings with trusted friends or family members can help you feel understood and supported. They may also be able to provide additional perspectives or suggestions based on their own experiences.

5. Consider seeking professional help: While I'm not a mental health expert, it could be beneficial for you to explore therapy or counseling options. Speaking with a licensed professional can provide you with personalized guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. They can help you explore any underlying issues, develop coping strategies, and work towards improving your overall well-being.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it's important to be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate these challenges. It takes time and effort to make lasting changes, but with perseverance and support, you can work towards feeling more comfortable and connected in your interactions with others. wish you the best on this journey of self"
"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen.

It's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique habits and routines, and it's not uncommon for family members to have different expectations or standards when it comes to cleanliness. While it's understandable that you're concerned about maintaining a clean and healthy environment, it's also essential to consider your father's feelings and potential reasons behind his actions.

It's possible that your father may be experiencing stress or anxiety due to your grandmother's upcoming surgery, which could be affecting his ability to focus on routine tasks. Additionally, he might have different habits or routines that he's comfortable with, and it may take time for him to adjust to taking on more responsibility in the household.

One approach to addressing this situation would be to have an open and understanding conversation with your father. Share your concerns with him, but also express your appreciation for all the other things he does well. You could also offer to help him learn new routines or techniques for cleaning and cooking, making it a collaborative effort.

It's also important to remember that your mother's absence may be causing additional stress for your father, so being patient and supportive could go a long way in helping him adjust to his new responsibilities.

"," It sounds like you and your dad have a good relationship overall, but there have been some issues with his hygiene and cleaning habits in the kitchen. It's understandable that you're concerned about germs and want to ensure a clean and healthy environment for yourself and your sister.

When trying to get your dad to follow basic hygiene practices in the kitchen, it might be helpful to approach the situation with patience and understanding. Instead of constantly pestering him, try having a calm conversation about your concerns. Explain why it's important to wash hands before cooking and clean the kitchen properly. You could also provide him with information or tips on how to properly wash his hands and clean different surfaces.

Additionally, consider finding alternative ways to ensure the kitchen is clean and safe if your dad is struggling. For example, you could offer to help him with the cleaning or take over certain tasks temporarily. This may alleviate some of the pressure and make it easier for him to learn and improve his skills.

Remember, change takes time, so be patient with your dad as he adjusts to taking on more responsibility in the household. It might be helpful to set small, achievable goals for him to work towards, such as washing his hands for a specific amount of time or thoroughly cleaning one area of the kitchen at a time. Celebrate his progress, no matter how small, and continue to provide support and guidance along the way.

Lastly, keep in mind that everyone learns and responds differently. While your mum may have played a significant role in ensuring the kitchen was clean before, it's an opportunity for your dad to step up and take responsibility.

It's normal to feel some anxiety in situations like these, but if your symptoms are severe and interfere with your daily life, you may have a condition called social anxiety disorder. Therapy and medication can help you manage your symptoms and regain control over your life.

"," It can be really challenging to experience such intense physical and emotional symptoms when you're in public or around large groups of people. It sounds like these situations trigger feelings of panic for you, which then manifest as light-headedness, sweating, and difficulty breathing.

One suggestion I have is to try some deep breathing exercises when you start to feel overwhelmed. Taking slow, deep breaths can help regulate your body's response to stress and anxiety. You can try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times until you start to feel more grounded.

Another technique that might be helpful is called progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups in your body, one at a time. By doing this, you can become more aware of any tension that may be building up and consciously release it. You can start with your toes and work your way up to your head, focusing on each muscle group for a few seconds before letting go.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to challenge any negative thoughts or beliefs you may have about public speaking or being in crowded places. Sometimes our minds can create exaggerated scenarios or outcomes that contribute to our anxiety. Take some time to reflect on these thoughts and ask yourself if there is evidence to support them. If not, try replacing them with more realistic and positive alternatives.

Lastly, consider gradually exposing yourself to these situations in a controlled manner. Start by practicing public speaking or being in small crowds, and gradually work your way up to larger settings. This allows you to build confidence and desensitize yourself to the triggers over time.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, so it's important to find what works best for you. If these suggestions don't provide enough relief, consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can offer additional guidance and support tailored to your specific needs. wish you the best on your path towards managing your anxiety in public and crowded settings. thanks for reaching out and sharing your experience.

It's understandable that this situation can be disheartening and make you feel unappreciated. It's essential to remember that everyone has unique preferences and expectations, and it's not always possible to meet everyone's expectations perfectly.

It's not uncommon for people to find it challenging to open up and share certain feelings or thoughts, even with a trusted therapist. The inability to identify and describe emotions can be a barrier to effective communication and understanding.

One approach to overcoming this challenge is to practice self-reflection and become more attuned to your emotions. This can be done through journaling, meditation, or simply taking time each day to check in with yourself and ask, ""How am I feeling right now?""

Another strategy is to familiarize yourself with a wide range of emotions and their associated words. This can help expand your emotional vocabulary, making it easier to express yourself more accurately and effectively.

Remember, your therapist is likely patient and understanding, and it's important to recognize the progress you've made in your therapeutic journey. It's also essential to acknowledge that the therapeutic relationship takes time to develop, and trust and openness can grow over time.

Your therapist's ability to be insightful and nail down your feelings with her questioning is impressive. It must feel validating and comforting to have someone who understands what you're experiencing. The fact that she finds the right word to help describe how you feel adds another layer of understanding and clarity.

To address your difficulty in identifying and describing your feelings, it might be helpful to explore different strategies. One approach could be keeping a journal or diary where you write about your experiences and try to reflect on any emotions that arise. This can provide an opportunity for self-reflection and increase your awareness of your emotions over time.

Additionally, practicing mindfulness or meditation techniques can assist in becoming more present in the moment and attuned to your emotions. Mindfulness exercises such as deep breathing, body scans, or guided imagery can help you connect with and explore your feelings in a safe and non-judgmental space.

Communicating your difficulties with your therapist is also important. Let her know that while you appreciate her insights and abilities, there are times when opening up feels particularly difficult. Together, you can explore potential reasons behind this difficulty and work on finding ways to make the process more comfortable for you.
