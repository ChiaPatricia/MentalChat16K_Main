"I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy).","你好！你的描述表明你可能患有一种被称为地域偏好的心理健康问题。这种问题是一种异常的地域偏好，它导致一个人需要知道他人的居住地点，以建立信任。

如果你认为这个问题对你的生活造成了困扰，那么你可以考虑寻求心理健康专业人士的帮助。他们可以帮助你探索这种偏好的根源，并提供策略来帮助你克服这种偏好。

2. 尝试关注你与别人的互动，而不是他们的居住地点。
3. 尝试与新的人建立信任，而不是依赖他们的居住地点。

希望这些建议对你有所帮助。"," It's understandable that knowing someone's whereabouts can help you feel more at ease and allow you to start building trust. However, it's important to remember that trust is a gradual process and it's not solely dependent on knowing someone's address. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Communication: Open and honest communication is key in any relationship. Take the time to engage in conversations with the person, allowing both of you to express your thoughts, feelings, and concerns. This can help create a sense of connection and understanding.

2. Vetting: Before sharing personal information, it's natural to want to gather information about someone. You can ask questions about their background, interests, and experiences. Look for red flags or inconsistencies in their responses. Trust your intuition and pay attention to any warning signs that may indicate potential risks.

3. Gradual Involvement: Building trust takes time, so start by taking small steps. As you spend more time with someone, you can gradually share personal information or spend more time at their place if you feel comfortable. This allows you to assess their trustworthiness over time.

4. Self-reflection: Consider your own trust issues and any past experiences that may have contributed to them. Reflecting on these factors can help you identify any patterns or triggers that may be influencing your thoughts and emotions. Working on building self-awareness can empower you to make more informed decisions.

5. Seek Support: If you find it challenging to trust others or struggle with trust issues, consider reaching out to supportive friends or family members who can provide guidance and understanding. Sometimes talking to someone you trust can offer new perspectives and insights.

Remember, trust is a complex and multifaceted concept that involves both emotions and actions. While knowing someone's whereabouts can be reassuring, it's essential to focus on building a foundation of trust based on mutual respect, communication, and shared experiences."

It's not uncommon to feel this way, and it can be challenging to know what you want out of life. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and it may take time to figure out your passions and interests.

In terms of being lazy and unproductive, it's understandable that you're feeling frustrated with yourself. However, it's important to approach this situation with self-compassion and patience. Start by identifying any underlying factors that might be contributing to your lack of motivation.

"Hi, within the past year I have been hospitalized three times and I have been in two treatment centers. I have been diagnosed with everything from Borderline to Bipolar with Psychosis, but all of my treating physicians say that those diagnosis’ are incorrect. I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can’t tell the difference between different emotions, I don’t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don’t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren’t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can’t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it’s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have people pulling me every which a way, I am tired of all of this. I feel like no one understands me. I know you don’t know me but can you tell me possibly what is going on.

Look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, dissociation, or other related areas. They may be able to provide you with new tools and techniques to cope with your symptoms.

4. Educate yourself: Learning more about your condition can help you gain a better understanding of what you're going through. There are many resources available online, such as books, articles, and support groups, where you can connect with others who have similar experiences.

"I’ve been dating him for 5 months now and I truly love him. He was brought up in a middle class environment but struggled when growing up because of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He has a job as an apprentice engineer and he has said he will often have angry outbursts at work if he gets something wrong and will hurt himself by punching steel or whatever is nearby. He has extreme beliefs like he will own a particular city one day and change things to suit his “ideal”. He has extreme beliefs that all murders and rapists should be killed (he lives in UK). He comes across quite shy when talking to people (I’m not just saying this cause he’s my boyfriend but he’s really attractive conventionally so you’d think he’d be more confident); he will willingly talk to people but not make much eye contact. He gets very paranoid that I will cheat on him and says if I ever do I’ll never see him again and he says I’m the only person he loves and he wants to marry me in the future even although we’ve only been dating 5 months. He can be quite controlling and doesn’t like me smoking (he caught me smoking at a party and had a random shouting outburst at his friend when he tried to intervene). Last night when we were at his mum’s house he told her everything about him feeling angry at the slightest thing and he started crying cause I’m the only one he’s ever told about these feelings. He says I am the only thing that makes him happy, but he thinks I’m too naive and always wants to be there to protect me always because he always thinks the worst of people he doesn’t know. I’m really concerned and his mum and I suggested he see a counselor even although he really doesn’t want to. His mum thinks he has depression?? What do you think it could be?","1.

Based on the information you've shared, it's difficult to determine a specific diagnosis without more information or professional evaluation. However, there are some common challenges that individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may face, such as difficulty managing impulses and emotions. It's possible that these struggles could contribute to his outbursts at work and extreme beliefs.

Regarding his extreme beliefs about murder and rape, it's important to remember that everyone has different values and opinions. However, it's concerning that he expresses such extreme views and feels the need to punish people he perceives as guilty. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding for the complexities of human behavior.

The fact that he gets paranoid about cheating and becomes controlling in his attempts to protect you is also concerning. It's important for both partners to have trust and respect in a relationship. Open communication and setting boundaries can help create a healthier dynamic.

Considering his parents' toxic relationship, it's understandable that he may have developed a fear of abandonment and a need for control. However, it's important to recognize that these patterns of behavior can be harmful and limiting in a relationship.

While counseling might be beneficial for him, it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Let him know that you're there to support him and that you believe he has the potential to work through his challenges. Encourage him to seek professional help, but also reassure him that you're there for him no matter what.

Remember, every individual is unique, and it's essential to approach this situation with patience and compassion. If you feel overwhelmed or unsafe, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional who can provide further guidance and support."

"I want to go back to my ex-husband from whom I’ve been divorced for over three years because of his violence. Before the divorce he ended up in jail for almost a year for domestic abuse. Since his release he says he’s changed. He’s gone to a local community mental health facility, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and adult ADHD. He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances. I see him on a regular basis and realize we still love each other, although it’s hard to believe that he loved me when he was abusive, which I now attribute to mental illness. The problem is threefold:","1. Legal and financial issues:
It's important to understand that going back to an ex-husband after a divorce can have significant legal and financial implications. You should consult with a divorce attorney to discuss the specifics of your situation and determine what steps you need to take to legally end your current marriage and establish a new relationship with your ex-husband.

Exploring these underlying conditions with him and seeking professional help can be beneficial.

2. Communication and boundaries: Open and honest communication is crucial in any relationship, especially when there have been past issues of violence.

"I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one. My parents divorced when I was nine and he immediately found a new girlfriend. They’ve been together ever since. I didn’t mind and actually liked the new family (she has a daughter my age), but when they moved in together I was never included as a part of the family and was treated as a “second-class citizen” by my stepmother. My father did nothing about this and usually took her side (albeit reluctantly) in order to avoid conflict because she threw fits if she didn’t get her way. I wasn’t allowed to use the nicest things in the house and was never allowed to be “better” than my stepsister–if the two of us came downstairs in similar outfits, I would be the one who had to go change. When I got a perfect score on the SATs, I wasn’t allowed to mention it because she didn’t do as well. These things seem trivial, and they are, but the gradual accumulation of this kind of thing over the years led me to resent him. I used to have pretty bad problems with depression–I lost 20 lbs in a month, my mood swung back and forth from hysterical to empty, I experienced dissociative episodes, self-medicated with drugs and I spent all my free time in bed, only coming out for meals. My dad didn’t ever acknowledge this and I feel like he was willfully ignorant about a lot of other things going on in my life. He never asked me about drinking, drugs, boyfriends, friends, and any difficulties I might be having and he never praised anything I did. I feel like I’m making him out to be a bad person, which he isn’t, but he just doesn’t want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he’d rather ignore it. He also (until I was in college) treated me like a child–I wasn’t allowed to hear bad words and he’d be obviously uncomfortable if I interacted in an equal way with adults in front of him. When he and his girlfriend temporarily broke up he became incredibly affectionate, which really upset me since he had consistently chosen his girlfriend over me for the past five years. He also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when I was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because I don’t eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction). He made fun of me for being a hypochondriac and continues to make hypochondriac jokes even when it’s really not funny–but that’s more of his denial and refusal to admit that things actually might be serious.","1. How can I improve my mental health?

Improving your mental health is a personal journey, and there are many things you can do to support yourself. First, it's important to recognize that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Consider talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide support and guidance. Additionally, make sure to prioritize self-care, which includes getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising, and engaging in activities that bring you joy. It's also important to practice self-compassion and work on building a support system of friends and loved ones who can offer understanding and support. Remember, healing is possible, and you are not alone in this.

2. How can I cope with past traumas?

Coping with past traumas can be a challenging process, but there are several strategies that may help. First, it's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings about the trauma. Allow yourself to feel and process your emotions without judgment. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide guidance and coping strategies. Additionally, practice self-care, such as engaging in activities that bring you joy, getting enough sleep and exercise, and eating well. It can also be helpful to connect with others who have experienced similar traumas, either through support groups or online communities. Remember, healing is a process, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.

3. How can I improve my relationship with my dad?

Improving your relationship with your dad may take time and effort, but it's possible. First, consider seeking support from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, who can provide guidance on building healthy relationships. Additionally, practice self-compassion and work on building a positive self-image. When interacting with your dad, try to approach the situation with an open and non-judgmental mindset. It may also be helpful to set boundaries and communicate your needs and expectations clearly. Remember, relationships take work, but the effort can be worth it in the long run.

4. How can I deal with my dad's lack of emotional support?

"," It sounds like you've had a difficult relationship with your father over the years, and it's understandable that you feel hurt and resentful towards him. It can be challenging when someone we love doesn't provide the support and understanding we need during difficult times.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that your feelings are valid and deserve attention. It's not uncommon for people who have experienced neglect or mistreatment in their relationships to feel a sense of resentment towards their parents. It's essential to give yourself permission to feel these emotions and not blame yourself for them.

When it comes to rebuilding a relationship with your father, it may be helpful to approach the situation with patience and open communication. While he might not be aware of the impact his actions have had on you, expressing your feelings and concerns in a calm and non-confrontational manner could help him understand how you've been affected.

Consider finding a time when both of you are calm and relaxed, and then express your feelings honestly and respectfully. Let him know about the specific instances where you felt excluded or treated unfairly, and explain how it has affected your relationship with him. Be sure to use ""I"" statements to avoid sounding accusatory, as this can create defensiveness.

Additionally, setting boundaries is crucial in any relationship. Clearly communicate what behaviors or actions you find acceptable and unacceptable. This will help establish a healthier dynamic between you and your father. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and establish boundaries that protect your emotional needs.

While rebuilding a relationship with your father may take time, it's also important to focus on your own healing and growth. Consider seeking support from friends, other family members, or even a therapist who can provide guidance and help you navigate through this process.

Remember, healing and rebuilding relationships takes effort from both parties involved. While it may not be easy, with patience, open communication, and self-care, it's possible to work towards a healthier and more fulfilling relationship with your father."

33."," It can be really challenging to talk about our emotions, especially when it comes to something as personal as mental health. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are steps you can take to address your concerns.

Firstly, it might be helpful to reflect on your own feelings and experiences. Consider keeping a journal or writing down your thoughts and emotions. This can provide you with a clearer understanding of what you're going through and help you identify any patterns or triggers.

Once you have a better grasp of your emotions, finding the right time and place to have an open conversation with your parents is crucial. Choose a calm and private setting where you feel comfortable expressing yourself. Start by explaining how you've been feeling lately and mention any specific symptoms you've been experiencing.

When discussing your concerns, try to use ""I"" statements instead of blaming or accusing language. For example, say something like, ""I've been feeling sad lately and I'm not sure why."" This approach can make it easier for your parents to listen and understand without feeling defensive.

Additionally, consider seeking support from a trusted friend or teacher who can act as a mediator during this conversation. They can offer guidance and help ensure that your message is effectively communicated.

Remember, opening up about your feelings takes courage, and it's okay to seek professional help if you feel overwhelmed or unsure about how to proceed. Many schools and communities have resources available for students who need additional support with mental health issues.

Take care of yourself and know that you deserve understanding and support."
