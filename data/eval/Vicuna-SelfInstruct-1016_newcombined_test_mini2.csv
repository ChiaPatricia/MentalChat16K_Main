"I have this issue where I need to know where people live. If I am with someone new, I feel like I cannot trust them, but if I know where they live, then I am calm and able to start the process of trust. (If they are trustworthy).","이 문제는 사람들의 주소를 알아야 한다는 것을 의미하는 것 같습니다. 이것은 일종의 의심과 격분을 나타냅니다. 이러한 감정들이 발생하는 이유는 매우 달라질 수 있습니다. 하지만 일반적으로는 사람들이 신뢰할 만한 인물들이 될 때 우리는 그들의 주소를 알아야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 우리는 의심과 격분을 느끼게 됩니다. 이것은 우리의 마음챙김 과정에 문제가 될 수 있으므로, 이러한 감정들을 해결하기 위해서는 우리가 알아야 할 일이 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해서는 우리가 다른 사람들과 더 깊은 관계를 맺는 것이 중요합니다. 이를 위해서는 우리가 다른 사람들과 더 많은 시간을 보내고, 그들과 대화를 나누는 것이 중요합니다. 또한, 우리는 다른 사람"," It's understandable that knowing someone's living location can help you feel more at ease and potentially establish trust. However, it's important to remember that trust is built over time and through various interactions, rather than solely relying on someone's address. Here are some suggestions to consider:

1. Take it slowly: Instead of immediately demanding someone's address, try taking things one step at a time. Allow yourself to get to know them better before considering sharing such personal information.

2. Communication is key: If you find yourself wanting to know someone's address, consider initiating a conversation about boundaries and trust. Express your concerns and ask if they feel comfortable sharing their living location with you. This open dialogue can help create an environment where both parties feel heard and understood.

3. Trust your instincts: While knowing someone's address may provide a sense of security, it's equally important to trust your intuition. Pay attention to your gut feelings and the overall vibe you get from the person. Trusting your instincts can be just as valuable as having concrete evidence of their whereabouts.

4. Focus on building rapport: Instead of solely seeking reassurance through knowing someone's address, prioritize building a strong rapport with them. Engage in meaningful conversations, show genuine interest in their thoughts and feelings, and engage in activities together. As you develop a deeper connection, trust may naturally develop over time.

5. Seek support from friends and loved ones: It's essential to surround yourself with a supportive network of individuals who can offer guidance and perspective. Discuss your concerns with trusted friends or family members who can provide insights based on their own experiences. Sometimes, hearing different viewpoints can help you gain clarity and make informed decisions.

Remember, trust is a gradual process, and everyone has their own unique journey towards building trust with others. By focusing on building rapport, taking things slowly, and seeking support from loved ones, you can create a foundation of trust that may not solely depend on knowing someone's address."
"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I am feeling very clueless at times. I don’t know what I want out of life in general. I’m basically sitting here, accepting failure and it’s not worrying me as much as it should. I’ve been feeling drastically lazy. Pretty much I just sit and watch TV and just spend my time very unproductively and don’t want to be this way. I’m not depressed; it’s just my mind and body won’t allow me to do things that I should be doing. If you suggest anything, please let me know. Thank you.","非常感谢您的信任。您描述的情绪和行为迹象表明您可能正在经历一种被称为“沮丧”的心理状态，这种状态可能会导致您感到沮丧、无动力和无聊。

以下是一些建议，可以帮助您摆脱沮丧状态：

1. 认识到您的感受是正常的：沮丧是一种常见的心理状态，很多人都会经历过。不要责备自己，尽可能接受自己当前的状态。
2. 制定目标：虽然您可能不知道自己想要什么，但您可以尝试制定一些小目标，以帮助您重新找回方向。例如，您可以尝试每天进行一个有意义的事情，如阅读有益的书籍或参与社交活动。
3. 改变生活方式：您可以尝试改变您的生活方式，以帮助您提高精力和动力。例如，您可以增加运动、改善睡眠习惯、减少毒饮料和刺激性食物的摄入等。
4. 寻求专业帮助：如果您的沮丧状态持续时间较长或者影响到您的日常生活，您"," It can be difficult when we feel clueless about ourselves and uncertain about what we want out of life. It sounds like you've been experiencing a lack of motivation and productivity, which is causing you to sit and watch TV instead of engaging in activities that could bring you joy or fulfillment.

Firstly, it's important to remember that feeling this way is not uncommon, and many people go through periods of uncertainty and lack of motivation. It might help to explore some potential reasons for these feelings. Have there been any significant changes or challenges in your life recently? Sometimes, external factors can contribute to our sense of confusion and lack of direction.

In addition, taking care of your physical health can also have an impact on your mental well-being. Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep can all support your overall energy levels and mood. While it may seem daunting to start exercising or making significant changes to your diet, small steps can make a difference. Consider setting achievable goals for yourself, such as going for a short walk each day or incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your meals.

Exploring hobbies or activities that genuinely interest you could also help you rediscover a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Start by identifying things that used to bring you joy or try out new activities that pique your curiosity. Even if it feels challenging at first, taking small steps towards pursuing these interests can gradually reignite your passion and motivation.

Additionally, finding a support system can provide valuable guidance and encouragement. Consider reaching out to friends, family members, or even joining local community groups where you can connect with like-minded individuals who share similar interests. Sharing your thoughts and experiences with others who understand can offer fresh perspectives and potential solutions.

Remember, change takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself throughout this process. If you find that these suggestions aren't providing the relief you seek, it may be helpful to consult with a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance and support tailored to your specific situation."
"Hi, within the past year I have been hospitalized three times and I have been in two treatment centers. I have been diagnosed with everything from Borderline to Bipolar with Psychosis, but all of my treating physicians say that those diagnosis’ are incorrect. I deal with chronic suicidal thoughts, frequent self-harm, I apparently engage in risky behaviors, I lack eye contact, I can’t tell the difference between different emotions, I don’t feel pain, I have social anxiety, I don’t like to be touched, I freak out if things aren’t in the right order or the same place, specific sounds drive me up a wall, I can’t concentrate with any noise, I get obsessed about certain things, I stutter whenever I read, I get overwhelmed/frustrated really easily, the only emotions I feel like I feel are angry, frustrated, and empty,and I apparently dissociate to a certain extent, I also think I may hoard some things, and I have trouble relaying to people through words what is going on/what I feel. The thing that mind-boggles me is the fact no one believes I live in two worlds, people from both world’s say that the other world isn’t real. In my other world my therapist there says that I should leave Earth so I can be there and be peaceful. I can go there, and my friends from there can come here. Sometimes they follow me around during the day and correct me when I am not doing what they want me too. I am so confused what place is real, I am sure you are going to say Earth is real, but what if it’s not, how do I know the right thing to do? Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore. I have people pulling me every which a way, I am tired of all of this. I feel like no one understands me. I know you don’t know me but can you tell me possibly what is going on. I would appreciate anything. Thank you!","😊 It sounds like you're going through a very challenging and confusing time in your life. I'll do my best to offer some insight and suggestions based on the information you've shared.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that mental health struggles can be incredibly overwhelming, and it's not uncommon for individuals to feel like they're in a constant state of confusion or disorientation. It's crucial to seek professional help from a mental health professional who can help you navigate these complex emotions and experiences.

Your description of experiencing two different worlds or realities is quite intriguing. It's possible that you're experiencing some form of dissociation, which can occur as a coping mechanism for trauma or overwhelming experiences. However, it's important to note that dissociation can also be a symptom of various mental health conditions, such as dissociative disorders or PTSD.

It's important to seek a proper diagnosis from a qualified mental health professional, who can assess your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment recommendations. They may consider a diagnosis of dissociative disorder or PTSD, or another related condition, and may also explore the possibility of co-occurring conditions like depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.

In the meantime, it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or family member for support, or even a crisis hotline like 988 in the US. Additionally, it may be helpful to practice grounding techniques to help you stay present and focused in the moment.

Remember, you are not alone in this, and there are resources and people who can help you navigate these complex emotions and experiences. It's important to be patient and kind with yourself as you work through these challenges."," It sounds like you've been through a lot and are dealing with a lot of challenges. It can be really difficult to navigate through these experiences alone, so I'm glad you reached out for help.

Based on what you've shared, it seems like you may be dealing with a mental health condition that is impacting various aspects of your life. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and I can't provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan. However, I can offer some general suggestions and guidance.

Firstly, it might be helpful to seek professional help from a mental health expert who can conduct a comprehensive evaluation and provide a more accurate diagnosis. They can also work with you to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs.

In addition to professional help, there are some self-care strategies that you could consider incorporating into your daily routine. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time in nature, can help improve your overall well-being. It may also be beneficial to practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage stress and anxiety.

Building a support system of understanding and empathetic individuals can make a big difference as well. Consider reaching out to trusted friends or family members who can offer a listening ear or lend a helping hand when needed. Sometimes, simply having someone to talk to can provide relief and comfort.

Remember, recovery takes time and patience. It's essential to be kind to yourself throughout this process and acknowledge that healing is a gradual journey. Surround yourself with positive influences and try to focus on small steps forward, celebrating even the smallest victories along the way.

Lastly, if you ever find yourself feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional. They can provide additional support and guidance tailored specifically to your needs.

I hope these suggestions are helpful to you. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there is hope for a brighter future."
"My 19 year old brother may be clinically depressed. He does not want to take any direction in his life. He does not want to do the typical things that a teenager would normally do. Meaning, he does not want to get a job. He does not want to finish college (he wants to quit). He does not want to get a driver’s license. In fact, he doesn’t seem to think that these types of things even matter.","1. First and foremost, it's important to ensure that your brother is safe and not engaging in any self-harmful behaviors. If he is, it's crucial to seek immediate professional help.
2. Clinical depression can present differently in each individual, and it's possible that your brother is experiencing a unique form of the illness. Encourage him to see a mental health professional for an evaluation.
3. It's natural for young adults to question their direction in life, and it's important to approach this with empathy and understanding. However, if his lack of motivation is causing significant distress or interfering with daily life, it's essential to seek help.
4. If your brother is not interested in obtaining a driver's license, it's important to respect his decision. However, it's crucial to ensure that he is still able to meet his basic needs, such as transportation to medical appointments or work if applicable.
5. It's important to approach your brother's situation with empathy and avoid being overly pushy or critical. Instead, try to have an open and non-judgmental conversation about his feelings and concerns. Encourage him to express his thoughts and feelings, and offer support and guidance as needed.
6. Encourage your brother to engage in activities that bring him joy and fulfillment, even if they are not typical teenage activities. Encourage him to explore different interests and passions, and offer support and encouragement as he does so.
7. Remind your brother that it's okay to take time to figure things out and that it's a normal part of the journey towards adulthood. Encourage him to be patient with himself and to seek help when needed."," It's important to recognize that feeling unmotivated and not wanting to engage in typical activities can be signs of depression. It's great that you're seeking guidance for your brother, as he may benefit from some support.

Here are a few suggestions to consider:

1. Encourage open communication: Try having an open and non-judgmental conversation with your brother about how he's feeling. Let him know that you're there to listen and support him, without pressuring him to take any specific action.

2. Seek professional help: Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide your brother with the necessary tools and strategies to manage his depression. They can also help him explore his thoughts and feelings more deeply.

3. Encourage self-care: Engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment can be helpful in managing depression. Encourage your brother to find hobbies or interests that he enjoys and make time for self-care activities such as exercise, spending time in nature, or practicing mindfulness techniques.

4. Set small goals: While your brother might not feel motivated to pursue long-term goals right now, setting small, achievable goals can still be beneficial. Help him break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps, allowing him to build confidence and momentum along the way.

5. Create a supportive environment: Surround your brother with supportive friends or family members who understand and respect his feelings. Encourage him to spend time with people who uplift his mood and provide a positive influence in his life.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. Be patient with your brother and allow him to take things at his own pace. Your support and understanding can make a significant difference in his well-being."
"I’ve been dating him for 5 months now and I truly love him. He was brought up in a middle class environment but struggled when growing up because of his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He has a job as an apprentice engineer and he has said he will often have angry outbursts at work if he gets something wrong and will hurt himself by punching steel or whatever is nearby. He has extreme beliefs like he will own a particular city one day and change things to suit his “ideal”. He has extreme beliefs that all murders and rapists should be killed (he lives in UK). He comes across quite shy when talking to people (I’m not just saying this cause he’s my boyfriend but he’s really attractive conventionally so you’d think he’d be more confident); he will willingly talk to people but not make much eye contact. He gets very paranoid that I will cheat on him and says if I ever do I’ll never see him again and he says I’m the only person he loves and he wants to marry me in the future even although we’ve only been dating 5 months. He can be quite controlling and doesn’t like me smoking (he caught me smoking at a party and had a random shouting outburst at his friend when he tried to intervene). Last night when we were at his mum’s house he told her everything about him feeling angry at the slightest thing and he started crying cause I’m the only one he’s ever told about these feelings. He says I am the only thing that makes him happy, but he thinks I’m too naive and always wants to be there to protect me always because he always thinks the worst of people he doesn’t know. I’m really concerned and his mum and I suggested he see a counselor even although he really doesn’t want to. His mum thinks he has depression?? What do you think it could be?","1.

It sounds like he has been through a lot with his upbringing and struggles with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It takes a lot of strength to open up and share these feelings, so I commend him for doing that.

Based on what you've shared, it's difficult to say for certain what might be going on. However, his extreme beliefs and controlling tendencies are definitely worth paying attention to. It's important to create a safe and open space for him to express himself, while also setting boundaries that feel comfortable for you.

Considering his mention of depression, it's possible that he may be experiencing some symptoms related to that. Depression can manifest in different ways in different people, including feelings of sadness, anger, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. It could be helpful for him to explore this further with a mental health professional who can provide a more accurate diagnosis and support tailored to his specific needs.

In the meantime, continuing to communicate openly and honestly with him about your concerns is essential. Let him know that you genuinely care about his well-being and want to understand what he's going through. Together, you can work towards finding healthy coping mechanisms and strategies to navigate any challenges that arise.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being as well. If you ever feel overwhelmed or unsure about how to proceed, reaching out to trusted friends or loved ones for support can be beneficial."
"I met my boyfriend nearly 2 years ago online. He is in the army and was soon to be sent to Afghanistan. He lived about 6 hours away from me but being that we just met I decided not to visit (for safety reasons). Once he was sent away, we became very close, we scheduled web cam dates, sent letters, emails, cards, etc.","1. How do you feel about your boyfriend being in the army and potentially being sent to Afghanistan?

It sounds like you may be feeling worried and concerned about your boyfriend being in the army and potentially being sent to Afghanistan. It is understandable to feel this way, especially given the distance between you and the uncertainty of the situation. It may be helpful to focus on the things you can control, such as staying in touch with your boyfriend through letters, emails, and webcam dates, and supporting him in any way you can from a distance.

2. How do you feel about the relationship with your boyfriend?

It sounds like you have a strong connection with your boyfriend, despite the distance between you. It's great to hear that you have been able to maintain a close relationship through webcam dates, letters, emails, and cards. It's important to continue nurturing this relationship and to communicate openly with each other about your feelings and concerns.

3. How do you feel about the possibility of visiting your boyfriend in Afghanistan?

It's understandable that you may not want to visit your boyfriend in Afghanistan for safety reasons. It's important to prioritize your own safety and well-being, as well as the potential risks associated with traveling to a war zone. It may be helpful to discuss your concerns with your boyfriend and come up with a plan for staying in touch and supporting each other from a distance.

4. How do you feel about the possibility of your boyfriend returning home?

It's great to hear that you are looking forward to your boyfriend returning home. It's important to stay positive and hopeful for the future, and to continue supporting each other through this time of separation. It may be helpful to make plans for when your boyfriend returns, such as visiting each other or moving in together.

5. How do you feel about the length of the relationship?

It's understandable that you were concerned for your safety when considering visiting him in person, especially given the circumstances he was facing.

Web cam dates and other forms of communication can be wonderful ways to maintain a connection with someone you care about, especially when they are away. Sending letters, emails, and cards are also great ways to show your support and affection.

In situations where a partner is serving in the military, it can add an extra layer of challenges and uncertainties. The separation and time apart can undoubtedly be difficult, but finding ways to stay connected and support each other can help bridge the gap.

One suggestion I have is to continue exploring new ways to communicate and connect. You could try scheduling regular video chats or phone calls to create a sense of being together even when physically apart. You might also consider finding shared activities or hobbies that you can engage in virtually, such as watching movies together online or playing online games.

Additionally, it could be helpful to establish a routine or schedule for your communication. This can provide a sense of stability and predictability, making it easier to maintain the connection between visits. Planning future visits or surprises for when he returns from Afghanistan can also help look forward to the time when you will be reunited.

Remember to take care of yourself throughout this journey. It's important to have a strong support system of friends and family who can offer emotional support during this time. Consider reaching out to them for guidance, advice, or simply to talk about your feelings and experiences.

Lastly, remember that relationships require effort from both parties involved. While it can be challenging to maintain a long-distance relationship, open and honest communication is key. Make sure to express your needs, concerns, and desires to each other, and be willing to work together to find solutions and compromises.

I hope these suggestions help you navigate this unique and challenging situation. Remember, every relationship is unique, and it's important to find what works best for you and your boyfriend."

"I want to go back to my ex-husband from whom I’ve been divorced for over three years because of his violence. Before the divorce he ended up in jail for almost a year for domestic abuse. Since his release he says he’s changed. He’s gone to a local community mental health facility, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and adult ADHD. He’s on medication and collecting social security disability and has a payee handle his finances. I see him on a regular basis and realize we still love each other, although it’s hard to believe that he loved me when he was abusive, which I now attribute to mental illness. The problem is threefold:","1. The first problem is the legal barriers of the divorce. It would be difficult to undo a divorce, especially if it was an uncontested divorce. The laws regarding divorce vary by state, but typically, a divorce can only be undone through a legal process known as annulment, which is rare and only granted in specific circumstances such as fraud or mistake.
2. The second problem is the trust issues that arise from the abuse. It would be difficult to trust him again, especially since he has not shown significant signs of change or remorse for his past actions.
3. The third problem is the potential risk to your safety. Even if he claims to have changed, it's important to consider that individuals with mental illness may have episodes of violent or abusive behavior, and it's crucial to prioritize your safety and well-being.

It's important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of reuniting with your ex-husband and consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional, a lawyer, and/or a support group for victims of domestic abuse before making any decisions.","1. The first issue is understanding the impact of your ex-husband's mental illness on his behavior and attitudes towards you. It's important to recognize that mental illness does not always directly cause abusive behavior, but rather it can be a contributing factor. In this case, it seems like his bipolar disorder, PTSD, and ADHD may have influenced his actions during the abusive period.

To address this, communication is key. You should consider having an open and honest conversation with your ex-husband about how his past abuse has affected you and express your concerns about the possibility of his mental illness triggering similar behaviors in the future. This can help create an environment of trust and transparency between the two of you.

2. The second challenge you mentioned is rebuilding trust after experiencing such trauma. Rebuilding trust takes time and effort from both parties involved. It might be helpful for you to set boundaries and establish clear expectations for your interactions with your ex-husband. This could include discussing what behaviors are unacceptable and defining healthy ways for him to show respect and support towards you.

Additionally, seeking support from friends, family, or even a support group can provide you with a network of individuals who understand what you're going through and can offer guidance and encouragement along the way. Surrounding yourself with positive influences can make a significant difference in your healing process.

3. The third aspect you mentioned is considering the long-term implications of reconciling with your ex-husband. While it's understandable that you still love him, it's crucial to carefully weigh the risks involved. Reflect on whether your ex-husband has taken meaningful steps towards personal growth and addressing his mental health issues.

Consider exploring therapy options for both of you, if possible. Couples counseling can be beneficial in helping you navigate your relationship dynamics and address any underlying issues that may arise. Additionally, individual therapy can assist your ex-husband in working through his challenges related to his mental health conditions.

Ultimately, the decision to reconcile with your ex-husband is deeply personal and emotional. Trust yourself and listen to your instincts. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and ensure that any decision you"
"I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was fifteen and I no longer care or want one. My parents divorced when I was nine and he immediately found a new girlfriend. They’ve been together ever since. I didn’t mind and actually liked the new family (she has a daughter my age), but when they moved in together I was never included as a part of the family and was treated as a “second-class citizen” by my stepmother. My father did nothing about this and usually took her side (albeit reluctantly) in order to avoid conflict because she threw fits if she didn’t get her way. I wasn’t allowed to use the nicest things in the house and was never allowed to be “better” than my stepsister–if the two of us came downstairs in similar outfits, I would be the one who had to go change. When I got a perfect score on the SATs, I wasn’t allowed to mention it because she didn’t do as well. These things seem trivial, and they are, but the gradual accumulation of this kind of thing over the years led me to resent him. I used to have pretty bad problems with depression–I lost 20 lbs in a month, my mood swung back and forth from hysterical to empty, I experienced dissociative episodes, self-medicated with drugs and I spent all my free time in bed, only coming out for meals. My dad didn’t ever acknowledge this and I feel like he was willfully ignorant about a lot of other things going on in my life. He never asked me about drinking, drugs, boyfriends, friends, and any difficulties I might be having and he never praised anything I did. I feel like I’m making him out to be a bad person, which he isn’t, but he just doesn’t want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he’d rather ignore it. He also (until I was in college) treated me like a child–I wasn’t allowed to hear bad words and he’d be obviously uncomfortable if I interacted in an equal way with adults in front of him. When he and his girlfriend temporarily broke up he became incredibly affectionate, which really upset me since he had consistently chosen his girlfriend over me for the past five years. He also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when I was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because I don’t eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction). He made fun of me for being a hypochondriac and continues to make hypochondriac jokes even when it’s really not funny–but that’s more of his denial and refusal to admit that things actually might be serious.","您好，很抱歉听到您的经历。您的父亲在您十五岁之后就与您的关系开始衰退，这可能是因为他在您离家出走后不再关心您，或者因为他不知道如何与您建立更好的关系。这种情况可能让您感到愤怒和沮丧，因为您感到被抛弃了。您也提到您的父亲对您的生活中的一些事情表现出了漠不关心的态度，这可能让您感到孤独和无助。

您提到您在您的父亲的陪伴下患有抑郁症，并且您的父亲在您需要帮助的时候没有给予您支持。这可能让您感到无助和孤立，并让您的症状更加严重。您的父亲也可能没有意识到您在面对的困难，或者他可能觉得他无法帮助您。这可能导致他选择避开这些困难情绪，而不是与您进行深入的交流。

总的来说，您的父亲可能没有意识到他如何对您的行为产生了负面影响，或者他可能觉得"," It sounds like you have had a difficult and challenging relationship with your dad, and I can understand how it has affected your feelings towards him.

While I cannot provide professional advice, I can offer some general suggestions that may be helpful for you:

1. Communication: Consider having an open and honest conversation with your dad about how his actions and behaviors have affected you. Express your feelings calmly and clearly, focusing on specific instances where you felt excluded or belittled. This can help him understand the impact of his choices and create an opportunity for change.

2. Set boundaries: Establishing healthy boundaries is important in any relationship. You can communicate your needs and expectations to your dad, such as being treated equally and respectfully. Make sure to be assertive and clear about what behaviors are acceptable and what are not.

3. Seek support: Consider finding other supportive individuals in your life who can provide emotional support and guidance. This could include friends, family members, or even support groups where you can connect with others who have had similar experiences. Having a network of support can help you navigate through difficult emotions and gain perspective on your situation.

4. Self-care: Prioritize self-care activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Engage in hobbies, exercise regularly, practice mindfulness or meditation, and ensure you are getting enough restful sleep. Taking care of yourself physically and mentally can contribute to your overall well-being.

5. Professional help: If you find that your emotions are overwhelming or persistently affecting your daily life, seeking professional help from a mental health therapist might be beneficial. They can provide you with additional tools and strategies to cope with your feelings and work through any unresolved issues related to your dad.

Remember, healing takes time and it's essential to be patient with yourself throughout this process. Your experiences have undoubtedly shaped your perspective, and it's important to acknowledge and honor your feelings while also considering what steps you can take towards building a healthier relationship with your dad."

It can be challenging to open up about such personal matters, especially when it involves seeking support from those close to us.

Firstly, it might be helpful to reflect on your own feelings and thoughts. Consider journaling or finding a creative outlet to express yourself. This can provide some clarity and help you gain a better understanding of what you're experiencing.

When it comes to broaching the topic with your parents, it may be beneficial to choose an appropriate time and place where you feel comfortable. You could start by expressing your concerns and feelings indirectly, such as saying something like, ""I've been feeling really overwhelmed lately and I'm not sure why. Do you guys notice anything different about me?""

Opening up to your parents can be nerve-wracking, so remember to take small steps and give yourself time. Share what you're comfortable sharing at first, and reassure them that you trust their support and guidance. If they respond positively, you can gradually delve deeper into your experiences and emotions.

Additionally, consider seeking out other trusted adults in your life who can offer support and perspective. A teacher, coach, or mentor might provide a safe space for you to discuss your concerns and receive guidance from someone outside your immediate family.

Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it's important to take care of yourself throughout this process. If you find that your symptoms worsen or persist over time, it could be beneficial to consult with a mental health professional who can provide further evaluation and support tailored specifically to your needs.

You are not alone in this, and there are people who care about your well-being. Take small steps towards seeking support and remember to be patient with yourself throughout the process."
