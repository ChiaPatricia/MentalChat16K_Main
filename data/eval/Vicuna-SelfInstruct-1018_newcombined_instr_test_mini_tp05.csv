It sounds like you have been through a lot and are currently experiencing a lot of emotional distress. It's great that you have already sought help in the form of medication and counseling. It's important to continue to reach out for support and to be honest with your therapist about your current struggles. Self-harm is a complex issue and it may take time to overcome, but with the right support and treatment, it is possible to overcome it. It's also important to address any underlying mental health issues, such as bipolar disorder, that may be contributing to your self-harm behavior. It's also important to work on developing healthy coping mechanisms to replace self-harm. It's also important to communicate with your boyfriend about your feelings and needs, and to seek support from friends and family if needed. Remember, you are not alone and there is help available."," It's really brave of you to reach out and share what you're going through. I can imagine how difficult it must be for you to deal with these feelings of self-harm and the urge to hurt yourself. It takes a lot of strength to recognize that you need help and support.

Firstly, I want to assure you that there are people who care about your well-being and want to support you through this. While quizzes can be helpful in gaining some insight into certain conditions, it's important to remember that they are not diagnostic tools. They are designed to provide general information and should not replace professional advice.

Instead of relying solely on quizzes, it might be beneficial for you to consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional. They can offer personalized support and help you explore your emotions and experiences in a safe and non-judgmental environment. They may also be able to provide additional resources or recommend appropriate treatment options based on your specific needs.

In the meantime, there are a few things you can try to manage your distressing emotions. One approach is to find healthy coping mechanisms that work for you. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or relaxation, such as painting, writing, listening to music, or spending time in nature, can help distract your mind from negative thoughts and provide a sense of relief.

Additionally, reaching out to trusted friends or family members who can provide emotional support can make a significant difference. Sometimes just talking about what you're going through with someone who cares about you can help alleviate some of the burden.

Lastly, please remember that recovery takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself throughout this process and celebrate even the smallest victories along the way. You deserve support and understanding as you navigate this challenging journey towards healing.

Please know that I'm here for you and believe in your ability to overcome these difficulties."

It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety related to various areas of your life. It's common to feel overwhelmed by the demands of daily life, and it's important to remember that you are not alone in this. It's great that you are seeking help and support. Let's work together to develop a plan to help you manage your anxiety and stress. It may be helpful to start by identifying your triggers and creating a plan to cope with them. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, can be helpful in reducing stress and anxiety. It may also be beneficial to talk to your doctor about medication or therapy options. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and seek support."," It can be overwhelming to have anxieties about various aspects of your life, such as finances, work, relationships, kids, and maintaining a household. It's important to remember that you are not alone in feeling this way, and there are steps you can take to manage and reduce these anxieties.

Firstly, it might be helpful to prioritize and break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. By doing this, you can focus on one aspect at a time and not feel overwhelmed by everything all at once. For example, if finances are a major concern, you could create a budget or explore ways to increase your income. If work is causing you stress, you could try setting boundaries or seeking support from colleagues or supervisors.

Additionally, finding healthy coping mechanisms can greatly help in managing anxiety. Engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, can provide a much-needed break from the stressors in your life. Practicing mindfulness or deep breathing exercises can also help calm your mind and reduce anxiety levels.

Building a strong support system is another crucial aspect of managing anxiety. Reach out to trusted friends or family members who can offer a listening ear or provide guidance when needed. Sometimes, simply talking about your worries can alleviate some of the burden you may be carrying.

Lastly, self-care is essential when dealing with anxiety. Make sure to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and taking breaks when needed. Remember to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion throughout this journey.

While these suggestions may not completely eliminate your anxieties, they can certainly help you navigate through them more effectively. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient with yourself and celebrate even the smallest victories along the way."
"When already in the ‘possible divorce’ zone does a husband forgetting your anniversary mean he might not love you? Me and my husband have had a rocky relationship but lately it has escalated to the point of talking about separating or divorce. 7 months after the wedding I found out he was having an affair with an ex. When confronted he blamed me and treated me very harshly. We ended up staying together but he would never speak of his infedelity really which has caused 8 years of questions, fears, and continuous pain for me. About a month ago I reached a point where I no longer cared about his reaction, I just needed answers! He admitted to a few things, one of which was having an affair with the same woman a year before we got married when we were having problems. I had accused him of this for 9 years but he denied it vehemently and made me feel horrible for even thinking it. Lying for 9 years using the same face, tone of voice, and sincerity that he uses when he says he loves me has left me with a lot of confusion and fear. On top of that our sex life has never recovered and not for lack of trying on my part.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

It's understandable that you're feeling confused and fearful in this situation. The fact that your husband lied to you for nine years about his infidelity is a serious betrayal, and it's natural to feel hurt and question whether he still loves you. The anniversary forgetfulness could be a sign of his lack of investment in the relationship, but it's important to consider other factors as well. It's possible that he's struggling with his own emotions and feelings about the situation, and that he may not be able to express his love in the way you need right now. It's important to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and feelings, and to seek professional help if needed to work through these issues together. Remember, it's not uncommon for relationships to have ups and downs, and it's possible to work through difficulties and come out stronger on the other side."," It sounds like you've been through a lot in your relationship, and it's understandable that you're feeling confused and fearful. It can be incredibly difficult when someone we love hurts us, especially when they deny their actions and make us question ourselves.

Firstly, it's important to recognize that forgetting an anniversary is not necessarily a reflection of love. Sometimes people forget, and it doesn't always mean something deeper. However, considering the context of your situation, it's understandable that you might feel concerned.

Communication is key in any relationship, especially during challenging times. It's important to have open and honest conversations with your husband about how you're feeling. Express your concerns, fears, and questions in a calm and non-accusatory manner. Let him know that you deserve honesty and transparency from him, and that it will help you heal and move forward together.

Consider seeking couples therapy as an option to work through these issues. A trained therapist can provide a safe space for both of you to express yourselves, process emotions, and learn effective communication skills. They can also help you explore ways to rebuild trust and strengthen your relationship.

In addition to therapy, take care of yourself individually. Engage in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of the relationship. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can offer guidance and perspective.

Remember, healing takes time, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve the pain you've experienced. Trust yourself and your instincts, but also be open to the possibility of growth and change.

Lastly, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional if you find that your emotional well-being is significantly impacted or if you need additional support throughout this process."
I noticed that I tend to avoid eye contact with others whether they are good friends of mine or a family member. I try to but always feel my eyes wet and irritated. Most of the times I can’t hold a normal conversation (I talk to others but not as much as I’d like to) and feel that I’m lacking concentration or don’t give enough attention to others and what they are telling me. On the other hand I often wake up feeling down(sad) and actually don’t want to communicate with anyone else. I used to think I’m just a shy person but I realised it could be something more. I’m 19 so shouldn’t it be like a second nature to me?,"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

It sounds like you may be experiencing social anxiety or social phobia. Social anxiety is a common and treatable condition that can cause feelings of fear, self-consciousness, and embarrassment in social situations. It can also cause physical symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and rapid heartbeat. It's not uncommon for people with social anxiety to avoid eye contact, as it can feel overwhelming or intimidating.

It's great that you're seeking help and considering that you're only 19 years old, it's completely normal to feel this way. There are many treatment options available for social anxiety, including therapy and medication. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that can help you learn new ways of thinking and behaving that can help you manage your anxiety.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and that help is available. Talking to a mental health professional can help you better understand your feelings and develop coping strategies to manage your anxiety."," It's great that you've recognized this pattern in yourself and are seeking guidance. Avoiding eye contact can be a common symptom of social anxiety, which can affect various aspects of our interactions with others. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and it's normal for individuals to have different levels of comfort when it comes to eye contact.

Social anxiety can manifest in different ways for different people. While some individuals may find it challenging to maintain eye contact, others may struggle with initiating conversations or fully engaging in them. It's essential to explore these feelings further to gain a better understanding of how they impact your daily life.

Consider keeping a journal to track your thoughts and emotions surrounding social interactions. This can help you identify any patterns or triggers that contribute to your avoidance of eye contact. Additionally, practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation can assist in managing anxiety symptoms during conversations.

Building self-confidence and overcoming social anxiety takes time and patience. One strategy you could try is gradually exposing yourself to situations that make you feel uncomfortable. Start small by practicing eye contact with people you feel comfortable around, then gradually work your way up to more challenging situations. Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process and celebrate even the smallest victories.

While I'm here to offer support and suggestions, it's important to acknowledge that I'm not a mental health professional. If you feel that your symptoms significantly impact your daily life or if they persist despite your efforts, it may be beneficial to seek guidance from a qualified mental health expert who can provide personalized strategies and support tailored to your specific needs."
"My Dad and I usually get on quite well. We have a lot in common, but whenever he cooks or cleans he doesn’t do the job properly. For instance, he won’t wash his hands before cooking or clean the sides down properly. I’m generally not that bothered by germs but everyone knows the basics of hygiene in the kitchen. I try to tell him that he should wash his hands, but he just get annoyed, and makes some excuse like he’s ‘thinking about other things’. 9 times out of 10 he doesn’t do the washing up properly either eg. there will still be oil on the frying pan. So when I try to do it or I tell him that it’s unclean he just gets irritated and says “your being rather annoying now” when I’m just trying to makes sure my sister and I get a healthy meal in a clean kitchen. My mum usually makes sure that the kitchen and everything else is clean but she’s away seeing her parents because my grandma’s going into surgery soon. Now my dad’s left with us he just seems incapable of doing even basic chores. I can’t keep pestering him but he doesn’t learn. It could be that he listens to my mum or that she does it usually and dad hasn’t had to do the washing up more than once every few days. I think it’s a bit of both.","Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

It sounds like your dad may have some difficulty with task completion, which could be related to a variety of factors, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), executive functioning difficulties, or other mental health conditions. It's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, as your dad may not be aware of the impact his actions have on others.

One strategy you could try is to provide specific, step-by-step instructions for completing tasks, such as washing hands or cleaning up after cooking. This can help reduce the likelihood of mistakes and improve the quality of the work. Additionally, you could offer to help your dad complete these tasks, or suggest that he divide the tasks into smaller, more manageable parts.

It's also important to have open and honest communication with your dad about your concerns and feelings. Let him know that you appreciate his efforts and want to help him improve, but that you have some specific suggestions for how he can do so. Encourage him to share his perspective and any challenges he may be facing, as this can help you better understand his situation and find solutions that work for both of you.

Remember, it's important to be patient and understanding, as it may take time for your dad to make changes and improve his habits. With patience, support, and open communication, you can help your dad develop healthier habits and create a cleaner, safer environment for your family."," It sounds like you're experiencing some frustration with your dad's cooking and cleaning habits. It's understandable that you want to ensure a healthy and clean environment for yourself and your sister. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Communication: Try having an open and non-confrontational conversation with your dad about your concerns. Express how important it is for you and your family to have a clean and healthy kitchen. Instead of focusing on his mistakes, try emphasizing the benefits of proper hygiene and how it contributes to a better meal experience.

2. Lead by example: Show your dad how to properly wash your hands and clean the kitchen. Demonstrate the steps he can take to ensure a clean environment. Sometimes people learn better through visual aids, so demonstrating rather than just explaining can be helpful.

3. Create a routine: Establishing a daily cleaning routine can help your dad become more accustomed to the tasks. You could create a checklist or schedule that includes specific times for cooking, cleaning, and washing up. This way, it becomes easier for him to incorporate these tasks into his day.

4. Offer support: Instead of nagging or getting frustrated, offer your dad your assistance in the kitchen. By working together, he may feel more involved and responsible for maintaining the cleanliness. You can also suggest setting aside dedicated time each day for specific tasks, where you both contribute to keeping the kitchen clean.

5. Seek compromise: If your dad is resistant to change, consider finding a compromise that works for both of you. For example, you could alternate weeks where one person takes care of the cooking and cleaning, or you could come up with a schedule that ensures both of you contribute equally to the chores.

Remember, change takes time and effort. Be patient with your dad and try to approach the situation with understanding and empathy. It's important to find a solution that works for everyone involved and promotes a healthy and clean environment for your family."

It sounds like you experience a condition known as social anxiety. Social anxiety is a common mental health condition that can cause feelings of fear, nervousness, and discomfort in social situations. It's important to seek professional help to address these symptoms and develop coping strategies. A mental health professional can help you understand the underlying causes of your social anxiety and provide you with tools to manage your symptoms. In the meantime, try to practice deep breathing exercises or engage in relaxation techniques to help calm your nerves before public speaking or in crowded situations."," It can be really challenging to experience such intense physical and emotional symptoms when speaking in public or being in large crowds. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, as many people struggle with similar anxieties.

One suggestion I have is to practice deep breathing exercises before and during these situations. Taking slow, deep breaths can help regulate your heart rate and calm your body down. You can try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding your breath for a moment, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Repeat this several times until you start to feel more grounded.

Another technique that may be helpful is called progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups in your body to promote relaxation. Start by focusing on one area at a time, such as your hands or shoulders, and tense those muscles for a few seconds before letting them go completely. Then move on to the next area, repeating the process until you've gone through your entire body.

Additionally, it might be beneficial to gradually expose yourself to situations that trigger your anxiety. Start with smaller crowds or speaking in front of trusted friends or family members, and gradually work your way up to larger groups or more formal settings. This gradual exposure can help desensitize you to the triggers and build your confidence over time.

Lastly, consider seeking support from a trusted friend or loved one who can provide encouragement and help you practice your public speaking skills. Practicing in front of someone you trust can make you feel more comfortable and less self-conscious.

Remember, overcoming anxiety takes time and patience. Be kind to yourself throughout this process and celebrate even the smallest victories along the way."

It sounds like you're experiencing feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. It's common to feel this way when we're constantly comparing ourselves to others and feeling like we're not measuring up. It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and it's not fair to compare yourself to others. Instead, focus on your own strengths and accomplishments, and try to build your self-confidence. It may also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies."," It can be really challenging when you feel like you're always falling short of others' expectations and that your efforts are not appreciated. It's important to remember that everyone has different ways of communicating and expressing their needs, so it might be helpful to explore some strategies that could improve how you navigate these situations.

Firstly, try to practice active listening skills. This involves not only hearing what someone says but also understanding their perspective and feelings. By doing so, you can gain insight into their expectations and ensure that you meet them as best as you can.

Additionally, consider setting clear boundaries and openly communicating your own limitations. Letting others know what you can realistically handle and explaining any challenges you may face can help manage their expectations. It's okay to ask for clarification or seek compromise if needed.

Building self-confidence is another crucial aspect. Recognize your strengths and accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. Celebrate your achievements and remind yourself of past successes. This can help boost your self-esteem and make you feel more confident in your abilities.

Lastly, remember that it's not solely about you. Sometimes, people's reactions or lack of appreciation might stem from their own insecurities or unmet expectations. Try not to take it personally and focus on your own growth and development.

While these suggestions may not completely eliminate all negative feelings, they can help you develop resilience and improve your overall well-being. Remember, you deserve to feel valued and appreciated for your efforts."

It sounds like you have a great therapist who has been very helpful to you. It's understandable that it can be difficult to open up and share certain feelings or thoughts, especially if you struggle with identifying and describing your emotions. One technique that may be helpful for you is to practice mindfulness, which involves being present in the moment and focusing on your thoughts and feelings as they arise. This can help you become more aware of your emotions and gain a better understanding of how you're feeling. Additionally, it may be helpful to try to reframe the way you think about your therapy sessions. Instead of seeing them as a time to ""open up"" and share your feelings, try to approach them as a collaborative conversation where you and your therapist are working together to gain insight and understanding into your thoughts and emotions. With practice and patience, you may find it becomes easier to share your feelings and thoughts with your therapist."," It's great to hear that you've been working with a therapist who has been extremely helpful for several years. It can be challenging to open up and share certain feelings or thoughts, even after a long time in therapy. It sounds like identifying and describing your emotions is something that you find difficult.

One suggestion I have is to try exploring different techniques or exercises that may help you become more aware of your feelings. For example, keeping a journal where you write down your thoughts and emotions throughout the day could be a useful tool. This way, you can reflect on your experiences and gain a better understanding of how you feel.

Another approach you might find helpful is practicing mindfulness. Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. By focusing on your senses and observing your surroundings, you can increase your awareness of your emotions and become better at identifying them.

Additionally, it could be beneficial to communicate your concerns about struggling to express your feelings to your therapist. She may be able to provide you with additional guidance or suggest specific strategies that could work for you. Remember, therapy is a collaborative process, and your therapist is there to support you in your journey towards healing and growth.

Lastly, don't hesitate to ask your therapist for clarification or explanation if something she says doesn't fully resonate with you. Open communication is important, and it's okay to ask for clarification or elaboration on certain points.

I hope these suggestions help you in your journey of self-reflection and emotional expression. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have moments of difficulty along the way. Keep an open mind and be patient with yourself as you navigate this process."

It's great that you're considering stepping out of your comfort zone and engaging in new social activities. Joining your co-worker for a dinner party can be a great way to meet new people and potentially make new friends. It's important to remember that it's okay to have boundaries and to communicate these with your partner. It's also important to recognize that it's normal for past demons to resurface, but it's up to you to decide how you want to handle them. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional if you're finding it difficult to cope with these challenges on your own."," It's great that you're taking the initiative to reach out and connect with others, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable at first. Building a support system and finding activities that bring you joy can definitely help in overcoming some of the challenges in your long-distance relationship.

When it comes to how you choose to spend your free time, it's important to remember that both you and your fiance have different preferences and needs. While he may encourage you to find friends and engage in new hobbies, it's also important for you to prioritize your own interests and passions. It sounds like cooking is something that brings you happiness, so pursuing that interest could be a great way to meet new people and potentially make connections with others who share similar interests.

However, it's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your fiance about your intentions. Let him know that while you appreciate his encouragement, you want to find a balance between doing things on your own and spending quality time together. Setting clear boundaries and openly discussing your expectations can help prevent any misunderstandings or conflicts down the line.

In addition to finding friends and pursuing individual hobbies, consider exploring ways to spend quality time together despite the distance. This could involve scheduling regular video calls or finding activities that you can do separately but still enjoy together, such as watching movies or reading books.

Remember, relationships require effort from both partners, and it's important to address any underlying issues or demons from the past. If you find that these arguments are becoming more frequent or causing significant distress, consider seeking support from a trusted friend or family member who can provide an outside perspective.

Overall, take small steps towards building your support system and finding activities that bring you joy. By prioritizing your own well-being while also maintaining open communication with your fiance, you can work towards creating a healthier and more fulfilling long-distance relationship."
