The user is seeking advice on whether to tell their doctor about their concerns regarding the medication they were prescribed for schizophrenia, and whether to request a psychological evaluation.
2. The user has been experiencing depression but not suicidal or homicidal thoughts, and has not experienced any symptoms of schizophrenia since stopping the medication.
3. The user feels that the doctor did not understand the cause of their previous episode and that the pressure to find a job may have triggered it.

It sounds like you've been through a lot, and I can understand how challenging it must have been for you to go through that experience at the atrium in Middletown, Ohio.

Firstly, it's important to remember that only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a diagnosis and prescribe medication. While I can't diagnose or prescribe anything, I can offer some suggestions based on your description.

If you feel comfortable doing so, it might be helpful to have an open conversation with your doctor about your concerns regarding the medication. You can share your experiences from the past few months and express your desire to explore other treatment options or potentially discontinue the medication. Keep in mind that your doctor may have specific reasons for prescribing the medication, so it's essential to approach this discussion with an open mind and a willingness to listen to their perspective.

If you continue to feel depressed without experiencing any concerning thoughts or behaviors, it may be worth exploring alternative approaches or seeking additional support.

They may be able to assist you in finding a doctor who specializes in your specific concerns or connect you with other individuals who have gone through similar experiences.

"I’m a man, and I’m soon to be married. I have been messing around with other men on the side. It started as a once in a while thing, but it’s been happening a lot. I don't know what to do.","非常感谢你跟我分享你的情况。你承认自己在做异性性行为，并且这种行为已经变得很频繁。这是一个很重要的问题，因为异性性行为可能会对你的婚姻造成负面影响。这种行为可能会导致你和你的伴侣之间的信任问题，可能会导致你们之间的矛盾和紧张。

Firstly, it's important to recognize that everyone has their own unique sexual orientation and desires. Exploring your sexuality can sometimes lead us down unfamiliar paths, and it's essential to give yourself permission to explore these feelings without judgment. Understanding your own desires can be a valuable step towards self-acceptance and finding inner peace.

While it's normal to have attractions or even engage in consensual relationships outside of a committed relationship, the frequency and intensity of these experiences may indicate a need for self-reflection. Consider taking some time for introspection to understand why you feel drawn towards other men and how it makes you feel. Journaling or talking to a trusted friend about your thoughts and emotions could help you gain clarity.

When it comes to the ethics of continuing these affairs, it's crucial to consider the impact they have on your upcoming marriage. Open and honest communication with your future spouse is key. Consider having an open dialogue with your partner about your desires, fears, and expectations. Trust and vulnerability are vital in building a strong foundation for a healthy relationship.

If you find that these attractions persist and cause distress or conflict in your life, seeking professional support from a mental health therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues could be beneficial. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation and help you navigate the complexities of your sexuality within the context of your relationship.

Remember, your journey towards self-acceptance and understanding is unique to you. Give yourself permission to explore your feelings while prioritizing your emotional well-being and the health of your relationship."

"I am going to try and make this as brief as possible. I have been having thoughts of violence, of killing people. I want to make it clear that I do not want to because I think of what that can do to my future, to my family, and to my friends. I will have daydreams or dreams that are so vivid and real to me. I do things basically to try to satisfy these violent thoughts and urges by watching certain shows or movies, playing violent games and reading about violent crime scenes for example. I will admit that I used to kill small reptiles and the occasional squirrel, never cats or dogs because I like them too much and no one notices killing of reptiles. I would dissect them and see what various things would do to their bodies. This is the first time I have ever admitted to such things because I know that these signs never point to good things plus it gives people the wrong idea. I don’t know what to do or how to handle this because honestly I don’t know a psychiatrist who would see me out of fear of I might hurt them or someone else.
