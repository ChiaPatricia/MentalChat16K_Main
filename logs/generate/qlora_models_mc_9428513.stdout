========================================Question 1========================================
A patient who was admitted yesterday with an adjustment disorder and depressed mood has not left his or her room. The psychiatric-mental health nurse's most appropriate approach at meal time today is to respond: A. 'I will bring your tray to your room, if it will make you more comfortable.' B.'I will walk with you to the dining room and sit with you while you eat.' C.'Where would you like to eat your meal this noon?' D.'You will feel better if you go to the dining room and eat with the others.'


Answer: B

Explanation: The patient is depressed and has not left their room, so the most appropriate approach would be to offer to walk with the patient to the dining room and sit with them while they eat. This would provide social support and encourage the patient to engage in a social activity, which can help to alleviate feelings of depression. Option A would not provide any social support, option C would not address the patient's depressed mood, and option D would not be appropriate as it would likely exacerbate the patient's feelings of isolation.

 Answer: B. 'I will walk with you to the dining room and sit with you while you eat.'

Explanation: It's important to involve the patient in their own care and involve them in decision-making whenever possible. Offering to walk with the patient to the dining room and sit with them during meal time shows that you respect their autonomy and are willing to accommodate their needs. By doing so, you create an opportunity for social interaction and a sense of belonging, which can be beneficial for individuals with adjustment disorders and depressed mood. Additionally, providing a supportive environment during meal times can help improve the patient's overall well-being.

 Answer: B. encourage the patient's interest in menu planning, food magazines, and cooking lessons, by leaving information and materials around the house.

Explanation: It is important to support the patient's recovery by providing opportunities for her to engage with food in a healthy and positive way. Encouraging her to explore menu planning, reading food magazines, and taking cooking lessons can help her regain a sense of control over her eating habits. By leaving relevant information and materials around the house, the patient will have easy access to resources that can support her in making healthy food choices. This approach allows her to gradually reintegrate food into her life while still prioritizing her overall well-being.
