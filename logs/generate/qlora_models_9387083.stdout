========================================Question 1========================================
I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I’ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I’m about to lose her, if I already haven’t. I throw things at her when I’m angry, and sometimes I hit her. I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want the situation to worsen. I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood. I'm ready to change. I need help now. I'm about to explode.

 It's great that you're considering counseling as a potential option for managing your depression and anxiety. Counseling can be a helpful tool in addressing these challenges and finding ways to improve your well-being. Here are some suggestions and guidance:

1. Research different types of therapy: There are various therapeutic approaches that can be effective for depression and anxiety. Some common ones include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and mindfulness-based therapies. Researching these options can help you understand how they might benefit you.

2. Find a qualified therapist: Once you've identified some therapy approaches that interest you, look for therapists who specialize in those areas. Consider factors such as their experience, credentials, and reviews from previous clients. A good fit with your therapist is crucial for a successful therapeutic relationship.

3. Communicate your concerns: During your first session with a therapist, it's important to openly express your concerns about your depression and anxiety.

4. Set goals and work together: Collaborate with your therapist to set realistic goals for your therapy sessions. These goals can be related to managing symptoms, improving coping skills, or exploring underlying issues contributing to your depression and anxiety. Working towards these goals can provide a sense of direction and purpose in your therapy journey.

Remember, everyone's experience with depression and anxiety is unique, so it may take time to find the right combination of strategies that work for you. Be patient with yourself and trust the process as you explore counseling as a potential avenue for support and growth.
