 D. 'You will feel better if you go to the dining room and eat with the others.'

Explanation: Encouraging the patient to join others in the dining room is a more appropriate approach as it promotes social interaction and supports their integration into daily activities. Eating with others can also provide opportunities for conversation and potential emotional support from fellow patients or staff members. Additionally, being in a communal setting may help reduce feelings of isolation, which can contribute to improved mood and overall well-being. Therefore, option D is the most correct choice.

Note: This answer is based on the information provided in the question. It's important to consider the specific circumstances and context of each situation when making decisions.
