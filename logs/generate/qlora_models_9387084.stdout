========================================Question 1========================================
I have anger issues that have worsened over the years because I’ve never dealt with my emotions. My anger has never been expressed physically until the past year. My girlfriend has had to endure these episodes. I love her, and I think I’m about to lose her, if I already haven’t. I throw things at her when I’m angry, and sometimes I hit her. I may not hit her enough to cause harm, but I still physically lash out at her. I don’t want to lose her, and I don’t want the situation to worsen. I am a lesbian in my early 30s, and I have been dealing with anger since my childhood. I'm ready to change. I need help now. I'm about to explode.

Firstly, it might be helpful to explore the underlying causes of your anger. Childhood experiences can have a significant impact on our emotions and behaviors as adults. Reflecting on any past experiences or traumas that may have contributed to your anger could provide valuable insights.

Consider seeking out resources such as books, online articles, or workshops that focus on improving communication skills.
